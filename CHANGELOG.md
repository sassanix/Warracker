# Changelog

## 1.0.2 - 2025-10-30

### Added  
- **CSV Import: Exact Expiration Date support (`ExpirationDate`)**  
  - Uses an exact `ExpirationDate` when duration fields (`WarrantyDurationYears`, `WarrantyDurationMonths`, `WarrantyDurationDays`) are all 0/blank and `IsLifetime` is `FALSE`.  
  - Documentation updated to include the new field and its conditional usage.  
  - _Files: `backend/warranties_routes.py`, `README.md`_

### Enhanced  
- **CSV Import: Partial commits with per-row errors**  
  - Successful rows are committed even if some rows fail; the response includes detailed errors for failed rows.  
  - Returns `200` for partial success; returns `400` only if all rows fail.  
  - _Files: `backend/warranties_routes.py`_  

- **CSV Import: Automatic duplicate name suffixing**  
  - If a `ProductName` already exists for the same `PurchaseDate` (in the database or earlier in the same file), the importer now auto-renames it to `Name (1)`, `Name (2)`, etc.  
  - Prevents hard failures for separate products that share the same name/date but have different serials/metadata.  
  - _Files: `backend/warranties_routes.py`_

 - **Permissions: Enhanced fixing process for upload folder and database**  
   - Updated entrypoint log to "Fixing permissions (database and upload folder)" and invoke `fix_permissions.py` for both scopes  
   - Split into `fix_upload_folder_permissions()` and `fix_database_permissions()`; recursively ensures upload ownership to `warracker:warracker` (uid:999, gid:999) with improved logging and connection retry handling  
   - _Files: `Docker/entrypoint.sh`, `backend/fix_permissions.py`_

## 1.0.1 - 2025-10-26

### Fixed  
- Container startup loop caused by insufficient PostgreSQL privileges in the startup permissions script.  
  - Wrapped the `ALTER ROLE ... CREATEROLE` in a safe DO block with exception handling so missing privilege is logged as a NOTICE and startup continues.  
  - No feature changes; service now starts normally without elevated DB privileges.  
  - _Files: `backend/fix_permissions.sql`_

  - _Files: `backend/db_handler.py`_  

- **Add Warranty modal tabs – responsive alignment**  
  - Adjusted label size and spacing below ≤740px to prevent wrapping  
  - Maintains icon+label pairing; five-step indicator consistent across breakpoints  
  - _Files: `frontend/style.css`_  

- **Frontend cache busting and version updates**  
  - Updated service worker cache and version checker for new logic  
  - Ensured clients receive updated assets  
  - _Files: `frontend/sw.js`, `frontend/version-checker.js`, `frontend/*.html`_  

- **PWA cache refresh and immediate activation**  
  - Bumped service worker cache to `warracker-cache-v20251024001` and added `skipWaiting()` + `clients.claim()` for instant rollout.  
  - Updated all `footer-fix.js` references to `?v=20251024001` and added to SW pre-cache to guarantee delivery of the scrollbar fix.  
  - Cleaned service worker pre-cache by removing a duplicate `script.js` entry.  
  - _Files: `frontend/sw.js`, `frontend/*.html`_  


- **Search enhancements**: Include Model Number in search across Home and Status  
  - Main view: Added `model_number` matching in quick search and filter pipeline; updated placeholder to mention model  
  - Status page: Enabled search by `model_number` in the recent expirations table  
  - Backend: Included `model_number` in statistics responses to support status page search  
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/status.js`, `backend/statistics_routes.py`, `frontend/index.html`, `locales/en/translation.json`_  

- **Status page – Archived support**: Archived warranties are now first-class on the dashboard  
  - Added "Archived" to the Status filter on the Recently Expired or Expiring Soon table  
  - Rows show an "Archived" status with neutral grey styling that matches warranty cards  
  - Backend statistics endpoints now include `is_archived` to power filtering and labels  
  - Updated table filtering/sorting: archived items are excluded from Active/Expiring/Expired, appear under All and Archived, and sort with proper priority  
  - _Files: `backend/statistics_routes.py`, `frontend/status.html`, `frontend/status.js`, `frontend/style.css`_  


### Fixed  
- **Global warranties view**: Global view on Index page now properly displays warranties from all users  
  - Backend: Added `GET /api/warranties/global/archived` and unified global queries using correlated subqueries to avoid row collapse  
  - Frontend: When scope = Global and Status = "All", merges archived warranties via the new endpoint  
  - Archived Global view now uses the correct global archived endpoint  
  - Cache bust applied to ensure updated logic  
  - _Files: `backend/warranties_routes.py`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/sw.js`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/status.html`_  

- **Global view: Model Number display**  
  - Backend: Included `model_number` in global and archived global warranty queries so the UI can render it correctly  
  - _Files: `backend/warranties_routes.py`_  

- **Localization completeness: Model Number labels across all languages**  
  - Added `warranties.model_number` and `warranties.model_number_optional` to all locales so warranty cards and forms display localized labels  
  - Fixed Polish locale: added missing `warranties.model_number`; removed duplicate keys in warranties/messages  
  - _Files: `locales/ar/translation.json`, `locales/cs/translation.json`, `locales/de/translation.json`, `locales/es/translation.json`, `locales/fa/translation.json`, `locales/fr/translation.json`, `locales/nl/translation.json`, `locales/ru/translation.json`, `locales/zh_CN/translation.json`, `locales/zh_HK/translation.json`, `locales/it/translation.json`, `locales/tr/translation.json`, `locales/uk/translation.json`, `locales/hi/translation.json`, `locales/ja/translation.json`, `locales/ko/translation.json`, `locales/pl/translation.json`, `locales/pt/translation.json`_  

- **Add Warranty modal tabs: tiny-screen overlap**  
  - Prevented tab labels from overlapping on very small devices (≤430px) by switching to icon-only tabs and enabling horizontal scrolling within the tab bar.  
  - _Files: `frontend/style.css`_  

- **Document URL links not visible unless notes existed**  
  - Fixed warranty cards hiding the document links row when only external URLs were provided (Invoice/Manual/Files). The visibility check now includes `invoice_url`, `manual_url`, and `other_document_url`, so URL-only links render without requiring a note or uploaded file.  
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_  

- **Chrome: extra page horizontal scrollbar**  
  - Removed `100vw` width and negative margin hacks from the footer script that caused horizontal overflow in Chrome; now uses `width: 100%` with zero side margins.  
  - _Files: `frontend/footer-fix.js`_

## 0.10.1.14 - 2025-10-06

### Enhanced
- Filters persist like view settings and survive navigation/view changes:
  - Persist filters (Status, Tag, Vendor, Type, Search, Sort) to localStorage and, when authenticated, sync to API preferences (`saved_filters`) for cross-device consistency.
  - Skip API writes on initial page load (mirrors view preference behavior) to avoid noisy saves.
  - Switching views now re-applies the full filter set via `applyFilters()` instead of resetting results.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/index.html`, `backend/auth_routes.py`, `backend/migrations/046_add_saved_filters_column.sql`_
- All Status includes archived warranties (personal scope): When Status is set to "All" (and not in Global View), archived warranties are fetched and merged into the list to give a complete view. Archived items are flagged and rendered with the correct labeling and actions.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_

- Index page filter persistence and reset refinements:
  - Restore saved Search input on load (value, clear button visibility, and active state styling).
  - Persist Search alongside Status, Tag, Vendor, and Type when applying filters.
  - Clear resets filters to defaults, removes saved `warrantyFilters` and `warrantySortBy`, clears Search UI, and closes the Filter popover.
  - _Files: `frontend/index.html`_
 - PyJWT compatibility: Updated authentication handling to support PyJWT 2.10.
   - _Files: `backend/auth_utils.py`, `backend/oidc_handler.py`_
 - Deprecated datetime usage: Replaced deprecated `utcnow()` calls with timezone-aware alternatives.
   - _Files: `backend/*`_
 - OIDC-managed user settings: Hide/disable settings managed by OIDC to avoid conflicting edits.
   - _Files: `backend/oidc_handler.py`, `frontend/settings-new.html`, `frontend/settings-new.js`_
 - OIDC attribute synchronization: Sync key OIDC attributes on login for consistency.
   - _Files: `backend/oidc_handler.py`, `backend/auth_utils.py`_
 - UX: Made the entire user menu item clickable (not just the text).
   - _Files: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/style.css`_

- Mobile UX: Hide user menu button on mobile and use hamburger as the sole trigger; when authenticated, the mobile menu uses the username as the section title for clarity. No desktop changes.
  - _Files: `frontend/mobile-header.css`, `frontend/script.js`_

 - Login page tablet logo (769–820px): Show the Warracker logo/title above the login form on iPad Air and similar tablet widths to match mobile branding.
   - _Files: `frontend/style.css`_

### Added
- OIDC admin via groups: Allow determining admin status from configured OIDC group membership.
  - _Files: `backend/oidc_handler.py`, `backend/auth_utils.py`, `backend/config.py`_
- OIDC admin group setting: Added configurable OIDC admin group in site settings.
  - _Files: `backend/config.py`, `backend/app.py`_
- Configurable upload folder: Make the upload folder path configurable.
  - _Files: `backend/config.py`, `backend/file_routes.py`_
- Secrets from files: Support reading sensitive settings from `*_FILE` paths.
  - _Files: `backend/config.py`_
- Secure default secret: Attempt to generate a secure secret at runtime if none is provided.
  - _Files: `backend/config.py`, `backend/app.py`_

- Mobile hamburger menu (≤768px): Added modern slide‑out panel with overlay for Index, Status, Settings, and About. Dynamically clones nav links and user/auth actions into the panel, locks body scroll while open, and closes on overlay or link click. Desktop layout unaffected.
  - _Files: `frontend/mobile-header.css`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/status.html`, `frontend/settings-new.html`, `frontend/about.html`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/mobile-menu.js`_

### Fixed
- Archived styling parity under All: Archived items displayed under "All" now use the same neutral styling as the dedicated Archived view (per-card `.warranty-card.archived` styles).
  - _Files: `frontend/style.css`, `frontend/script.js`_
- Exclude archived from non-archived filters: Archived warranties no longer appear under specific status filters (Active, Expiring, Expired). They show only under "All" and "Archived".
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_
- Re-merge archived after filter changes: Switching away from Archived and back to All reliably reloads and re-merges archived items to keep the view consistent.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_
 - OIDC reload: Fixed OIDC client reload by moving `init_oidc_client` to an appropriate lifecycle.
   - _Files: `backend/oidc_handler.py`, `backend/app.py`_
 - OIDC userinfo: Stopped relying on token `userinfo` claim; use the userinfo endpoint as source of truth.
   - _Files: `backend/oidc_handler.py`_

- Settings page mobile menu toggle: Fixed initialization by isolating the hamburger logic into a dedicated script to avoid duplicate identifier errors in the global script, ensuring the menu opens/closes correctly.
  - _Files: `frontend/mobile-menu.js`, `frontend/settings-new.html`, `frontend/script.js`_

- Login page header/menu regression: Restored standalone login page by removing header/hamburger and mobile menu assets.
  - _Files: `frontend/login.html`_

- Login button label corrected: Button now reads just "Login"; page title uses a separate translation key to avoid suffix leaking into the button. Introduced `auth.login_title` and updated the login page to reference it.
  - _Files: `locales/en/translation.json`, `frontend/login.html`_

- Status dashboard tablet layout (769–820px, iPad Air): Summary cards now display in two rows with Active and Expiring Soon on the first row, and Expired and Total on the second row for clearer hierarchy at this width.
  - _Files: `frontend/style.css`_

### Credit
- OIDC and configuration improvements contributed by @tecosaur in PR #138.

## 0.10.1.13 - 2025-09-29

### Added
- Turkish language support added to all pages (index, about, status, settings) with comprehensive translations for UI elements, messages, and system text.
  - _Files: `locales/tr/translation.json`_

### Enhanced
- Modernized Login Page UI with a clean two-column layout (branding showcase + form), refined form controls with icons, improved separator, and provider-branded SSO button styling. Fully responsive and theme-aware (light/dark) with styles scoped to the login page only to prevent regressions elsewhere.
  - Preserved all original element IDs and existing functionality (local login, OIDC/SSO).
  - _Files: `frontend/login.html`, `frontend/style.css`_

- Refactored Warranty Filters and Sort UI on Index Page with modern popover-based interface to declutter the main interface while preserving all functionality.
  - **Filter/Sort Popover System:** Replaced individual filter dropdowns with clean "Filter" and "Sort" buttons that open organized popover panels containing all original filtering and sorting controls.
  - **Data Management Consolidation:** Combined separate Import/Export buttons into a unified "Data" dropdown menu with Import and Export options.
  - **Button Styling Unification:** Applied consistent bordered button styling with proper hover states and alignment across Filter, Sort, Data, and Tags buttons.
  - **Responsive Layout:** Implemented flexible search row layout that wraps gracefully on smaller screens while maintaining button alignment and functionality.
  - **Theme Compatibility:** All new UI components fully support existing light and dark themes using application CSS variables.
  - **Zero-Impact Implementation:** Changes strictly limited to `frontend/index.html` and `frontend/style.css` with all original element IDs preserved for JavaScript compatibility.
  - _Files: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/style.css`_

- Persisted Filters, Sort, and Indicator Across Sessions:
  - Saves Status, Tag, Vendor, and Warranty Type filters and Sort selection to localStorage (user-specific prefix) on Apply/change and restores them on load.
  - Filter indicator (green dot) now reflects persisted state across navigations and reloads.
  - _Files: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/script.js`_

- Tag Management and Live Updates:
  - Auto-save color changes in Manage Tags; changes persist immediately without Edit/Save.
  - Live UI refresh after tag create/update/delete; tag lists, selections, filters, and warranty cards update without page reload.
  - CSV import now refreshes the tags list to include any newly created tags.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_

- Modern Tag Management Modal UI:
  - `renderExistingTags`: Builds a table with Color, Name, Actions; rows include display spans and hidden inputs to enable inline editing.
  - `addTagManagementEventListeners`: Delegated handlers for edit, save, cancel, delete, and color changes; attached once per modal open to avoid duplicates.
  - `editTag`: Toggles the row into inline edit mode by showing inputs and swapping action groups.
  - `updateTag`: Performs API update; on success, reloads tags and re-renders the modal and dependent UIs (selected tags, filters, warranty cards), then toasts success. `openTagManagementModal` ensures listeners are present.
  - Styles: Appended “MODERN TAG MANAGEMENT MODAL STYLES” for the table, hover states, color swatch with hidden color input, inline name input, and action groups; uses CSS variables for light/dark compatibility.
  - Scope/Safety: Changes are confined to the tag management modal UI; CRUD flows preserved. On update/delete, the modal, tags in forms, filter dropdowns, and warranty cards re-render appropriately.
  - Test: Open Manage Tags to see the table; Edit toggles inline fields; Save updates via API; Cancel restores values; color swatch opens native picker and updates preview; Delete prompts and removes; Create adds rows; all changes reflect on cards and in filters; verify responsiveness and dark theme.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/style.css`_

- Mobile view: Filter/Sort label compaction on small screens
  - Auto-hide Filter and Sort button text up to 425px (icons-only) to preserve space without changing behavior or popover anchoring.
  - _Files: `frontend/mobile-header.css`_
  - 3-row mobile layout: Row 1 is Search (full-width); Row 2 groups Filter | Sort | Data; Row 3 places Tags | View | Scope for better usability on narrow screens.
  - _Files: `frontend/mobile-header.css`_

### Added
- Mobile logo and title: On screens ≤768px, a centered Warracker logo with the “Warracker” label is displayed above the login form for better brand presence.
  - _Files: `frontend/login.html`, `frontend/style.css`_

- Non-Destructive Warranty Archive: Allow users to archive old/expired warranties without deleting data. Archived items are hidden from the default lists and can be viewed via an explicit Archived filter.
  - Default behavior preserved: main endpoints continue to return only non-archived warranties; no UX change unless Archived filter is selected.
  - Reversible: users can unarchive items to return them to the main list.
  - Soft delete only: implemented via `archived_at` timestamp; no DELETEs performed for this feature.
  - API:
    - New `GET /api/warranties/archived` (user scope) to fetch archived warranties.
    - New `PATCH /api/warranties/{id}/archive` with body `{ "archived": true|false }` to toggle archive state.
    - Existing `GET /api/warranties` updated to exclude archived; global and admin listing endpoints also exclude archived by default.
  - Database: migration adds nullable `archived_at` column with partial index (`WHERE archived_at IS NULL`).
  - Notifications: expiring-warranty notifications ignore archived warranties.
  - Frontend:
    - Added “Archived” to Status filter; selecting it loads the archived endpoint.
    - Archive/Unarchive buttons on cards (Edit disabled in archived view). Bottom status row shows “Archived”.
    - Neutral archived styling (top header and card accents use gray; avoids red/green/orange).
  - _Files: `backend/migrations/045_add_archived_at_to_warranties.sql`, `backend/warranties_routes.py`, `backend/notifications.py`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/style.css`_

### Fixed
- Dark mode input visibility: Username/password text and caret now use theme text colors; placeholders use appropriate contrast in both themes.
- SSO button alignment: Preserved baseline `btn-sso` alignment class while applying provider-specific classes (e.g., Google, GitHub) to keep the button centered and branded.
- i18n safety: Mapped showcase description to existing translation keys to avoid missing-translation warnings.
- Mobile usability: Re-enabled scrolling and adjusted spacing to ensure the page fits better on small screens; limited the mobile logo to ≤768px and stacked it above the form.
  - _Files: `frontend/login.html`, `frontend/style.css`_

- Resolved JavaScript error “Identifier 'isArchivedView' has already been declared” that prevented warranty loading after introducing the Archived filter.
  - Removed duplicate `const isArchivedView` declaration and streamlined archived-data loading flow.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_

 - Dark mode navigation consistency (mobile and desktop): unify `.nav-link` hover/active backgrounds across pages so Status behaves like Home when dark mode is enabled.
  - _Files: `frontend/header-fix.css`_

 - Localization and i18n completeness:
   - Added empty-archive messages: `messages.no_warranties_found`, `messages.no_warranties_found_add_first` (English base + propagated to all locales) to prevent raw keys.
   - Added missing Claims section keys to all locales (English placeholders where needed).
   - Fixed Italian placeholder to use `{{days}} {{dayText}}` for `warranties.days_remaining`.
   - Added missing `warranty_period` in Czech.
   - Updated language lists: added `ko` to Portuguese and Japanese.
   - _Files: `locales/en/translation.json`, `locales/fr/translation.json`, `locales/es/translation.json`, `locales/de/translation.json`, `locales/it/translation.json`, `locales/nl/translation.json`, `locales/cs/translation.json`, `locales/pt/translation.json`, `locales/ru/translation.json`, `locales/uk/translation.json`, `locales/zh_CN/translation.json`, `locales/zh_HK/translation.json`, `locales/ja/translation.json`, `locales/ko/translation.json`, `locales/ar/translation.json`, `locales/fa/translation.json`, `locales/hi/translation.json`_



## 0.10.1.12 - 2025-09-18

### Fixed
- **Paperless-ngx Document Upload Duplicate Detection:** Fixed critical bug where incorrect API parameter caused all new document uploads to Paperless-ngx to be falsely identified as duplicates, preventing new documents from being uploaded and instead linking them to existing unrelated documents.
  - **Root Cause:** The duplicate detection logic was using an invalid API parameter `checksum` instead of the correct `checksum__iexact` parameter when querying Paperless-ngx for existing documents, causing the API to return unexpected results that incorrectly matched all uploads as duplicates.
  - **Solution:** Corrected the API parameter from `checksum` to `checksum__iexact` to properly perform exact checksum matching against existing documents in Paperless-ngx.
  - **Impact:** Users can now successfully upload new documents to Paperless-ngx without false duplicate warnings, while legitimate duplicate detection continues to work correctly for actual duplicate files.
  - **Credit:** Fix contributed by @sjafferali in PR #127.
  - _Files: `backend/paperless_handler.py`_

### Enhanced
- **Production Database Driver Optimization:** Replaced `psycopg2-binary` with `psycopg2` for improved production stability and performance.
  - **Production Best Practice:** Switched from the development-oriented `psycopg2-binary` package to the production-recommended `psycopg2` package to avoid potential conflicts with system libraries and improve runtime stability.
  - **Build Dependencies:** The existing Dockerfile already contains all necessary build dependencies (`build-essential`, `libpq-dev`) required to compile `psycopg2` from source.
  - **Impact:** Enhanced production deployment stability while maintaining full PostgreSQL database connectivity and compatibility.
  - _Files: `backend/requirements.txt`_

- **Development Environment Library Access:** Removed `/lib` directory from .gitignore to allow tracking of essential library files in the repository.
  - **Repository Management:** Updated .gitignore configuration to include library files that were previously excluded from version control.
  - **Impact:** Ensures necessary library dependencies are properly tracked and available for development and deployment processes.
  - _Files: `.gitignore`_

### Fixed
- **Missing JavaScript Assets for Non-Docker Installations:** Fixed critical error preventing the status page and internationalization features from functioning correctly in non-Docker installations due to missing i18next library files.
  - **Root Cause:** The `/lib` directory containing essential i18next JavaScript libraries was excluded from version control via .gitignore, causing these files to be missing in non-Docker deployments where they couldn't be served from CDN.
  - **Solution:** Updated service worker cache configuration to include the three required i18next library files (`i18next.min.js`, `i18nextHttpBackend.min.js`, `i18nextBrowserLanguageDetector.min.js`) and incremented cache version to ensure users receive the updated assets.
  - **Impact:** Status page and all internationalization features now work correctly in non-Docker installations, eliminating JavaScript errors and ensuring consistent functionality across all deployment methods.
  - **Cache Update:** Service worker cache version updated from `v20250119001` to `v20250918001` to force cache refresh for existing users.

- **Paperless-ngx API Token Authentication with 2FA Enabled:** Resolved critical authentication failure when using API tokens with Paperless-ngx instances that have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled. Users can now securely connect Warracker to their 2FA-protected Paperless-ngx accounts without compromising security.
  - **Root Cause:** The Paperless-ngx integration was inadvertently using session-based authentication paths that conflicted with 2FA requirements, causing API token requests to be rejected even when tokens were valid.
  - **Solution:** Implemented pure token-only authentication by clearing cookies before each request, disabling automatic redirects to login pages, and ensuring all API calls use only the `Authorization: Token <token>` header without session interference.
  - **Enhanced Error Handling:** Added detection and clear error messaging for authentication redirects (3xx responses) that would indicate token rejection, helping users troubleshoot configuration issues.
  - **Backward Compatibility:** All existing functionality remains unchanged for users without 2FA enabled, ensuring seamless operation across different Paperless-ngx configurations.
  - **Security Maintained:** Users can keep 2FA enabled on their Paperless-ngx accounts while using API tokens for Warracker integration, maintaining the highest security standards.

  - **Smart Context Detection:** System automatically detects when viewing another user's Paperless-ngx documents in Global View and overrides individual user preferences to default to in-app viewing.
  - **Improved User Experience:** Users can now view invoices, manuals, and other Paperless-ngx documents from other users directly within Warracker without being redirected to external Paperless-ngx interface, maintaining workflow continuity.
  - **Preserved Personal Preferences:** User's personal Paperless-ngx viewing preferences remain unchanged for their own documents, only affecting the viewing behavior for other users' documents in Global View.
  - **Consistent Interface:** Provides uniform document viewing experience across all Global View documents while respecting user privacy and access controls.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_

- **Warranty Claims Visual Status Indicators:** Added intuitive visual indicators to warranty cards that display claim status at-a-glance through color-coded Claims buttons, eliminating the need to open modals to check claim activity.
  - **Purple Claims Button:** Warranties with open claims (Submitted or In Progress status) display a purple Claims button with subtle pulsing animation to draw attention to items requiring action.
  - **Blue Claims Button:** Warranties with finished claims (Resolved, Denied, Approved, or Cancelled status) display a blue Claims button indicating completed claim activity.
  - **Default Claims Button:** Warranties with no claims retain standard gray styling, providing clear visual distinction between different claim states.
  - **Enhanced User Experience:** Users can instantly identify warranty claim status from the main view without opening individual claim modals, improving workflow efficiency and claim management visibility.
  - **Smart Tooltips:** Claims buttons display contextual tooltips ("Claims", "Claims (Open)", "Claims (Finished)") providing additional status information on hover.
  - **Database Integration:** Backend APIs enhanced to calculate and return claim status summary (NO_CLAIMS, OPEN, FINISHED) across all warranty listing endpoints including main view, admin view, and global view.
  - _Files: `backend/warranties_routes.py`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/style.css`_

- **Global View Warranty Claims Read-Only Access:** Users can now view warranty claims from other users' warranties in Global View mode with appropriate read-only permissions, enhancing transparency and claim visibility across the organization.
  - **Read-Only Claims Viewing:** Users in Global View can access and view detailed warranty claims information for warranties owned by other users, providing comprehensive claim visibility while maintaining data security.
  - **Permission-Based Access Control:** Claims viewing respects existing Global View permissions - users can only view claims if Global View is enabled and they have appropriate access rights (admin-only restrictions apply when configured).
  - **Intuitive UI Indicators:** Claims modals clearly indicate read-only mode with "View Only" labels, hidden edit/delete buttons, and contextual messaging to prevent confusion about access levels.
  - **Seamless Integration:** Claims buttons remain fully functional in Global View, eliminating the "Failed to load claims" error and providing consistent user experience across all warranty views.
  - **Preserved Security:** Create, edit, and delete operations remain restricted to warranty owners only, ensuring data integrity while expanding read access appropriately.
  - _Files: `backend/warranties_routes.py`, `frontend/script.js`_

### Fixed
- **Global View Document Access Authorization:** Fixed authorization issue preventing users from viewing invoices and manuals of other users' warranties when Global View is enabled. Users can now access shared warranty documents (invoices, manuals, photos, URL links, and Paperless-ngx documents) in Global View while maintaining privacy for sensitive "other documents".
  - **Root Cause:** The secure file access endpoint restricted invoice and manual access to warranty owners only, even when Global View was active and should allow broader document sharing. Additionally, the Global View API endpoints were missing Paperless-ngx document IDs and URL fields in their database queries, preventing these documents from being displayed in the frontend.
  - **Solution:** Extended global view permissions logic to include invoice_path, manual_path, paperless_invoice_id, and paperless_manual_id alongside existing product_photo_path support, while explicitly maintaining privacy restrictions for other_document_path and paperless_other_id. Fixed Global View API endpoints to include all document fields (paperless_invoice_id, paperless_manual_id, paperless_photo_id, paperless_other_id, invoice_url, manual_url, other_document_url) in database queries. Enhanced frontend document link generation to properly show all shared document types in Global View with appropriate permission checks.
  - **Security:** Maintains strict privacy controls ensuring "other documents" remain accessible only to warranty owners, and users still cannot edit or delete warranties they don't own. All document access remains read-only in Global View.
  - **Impact:** Users can now view and access invoices, manuals, photos, URL links, and Paperless-ngx documents of other users' warranties when Global View is enabled, providing complete transparency and document sharing capabilities while preserving essential privacy boundaries.
  - _Files: `backend/file_routes.py`, `backend/warranties_routes.py`, `frontend/script.js`_

- **Warranty Claims Creation with Empty Optional Fields:** Fixed critical bug where creating warranty claims with empty 'description' or 'resolution' fields resulted in internal server errors. These fields are now properly handled as optional, allowing users to create claims with only required information (claim date) and add details later as needed.
  - **Root Cause:** The application was not correctly converting empty strings to NULL values for optional database fields, causing database insertion errors.
  - **Solution:** Implemented explicit empty string to NULL conversion logic for description and resolution fields during claim creation, ensuring database compatibility and preventing server errors.
  - **Impact:** Users can now successfully create warranty claims with minimal required information and update them with additional details when available, improving workflow flexibility.
  - _Files: `backend/warranties_routes.py`_

- **Global View Claims Modal JavaScript Errors:** Fixed critical JavaScript errors preventing warranty claims modals from opening in Global View mode due to undefined function references, ensuring seamless claims viewing functionality across all view modes.
  - **Root Cause:** The claims modal initialization code was calling non-existent functions `getCurrentUserId()` and `getViewScope()` instead of using the established patterns for accessing user information and view state in the codebase.
  - **Solution:** Replaced undefined function calls with the correct inline patterns used throughout the application - using an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to extract user ID from localStorage and directly accessing the global `isGlobalView` variable for view state detection.
  - **Impact:** Users can now successfully open and view warranty claims in Global View mode without JavaScript errors, completing the read-only claims access functionality and providing full transparency for warranty claim information across the organization.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_


## 0.10.1.10 - 2025-08-30

### Enhanced
- **URL/Link Support for Documents and Invoices:** Introduced comprehensive URL/Link support allowing users to add external URLs for their documents (invoices, manuals, and other files) in addition to the existing file upload functionality. This enhancement provides flexible document management options while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing features.
  - **Database Schema:** Added three nullable columns (`invoice_url`, `manual_url`, `other_document_url`) to the warranties table via migration 043, ensuring zero impact on existing records.
  - **Complete Modal Integration:** Enhanced both Add and Edit warranty modals across all pages with intuitive URL input fields featuring link icons and clean visual integration alongside existing file upload sections. Added URL input fields to both the homepage edit modal (`index.html`) and status page edit modal (`status.html`) for complete feature parity.
  - **Dual Display Support:** Updated warranty cards to display both file links and URL links side by side, with URL links opening in new tabs for seamless external document access.
  - **Smart Summary:** Enhanced the Add Warranty summary to intelligently display either uploaded file names or "URL: [link]" when URLs are provided instead of files.
  - **API Enhancement:** Extended backend API endpoints to handle URL fields in warranty creation, updates, and retrieval with proper form validation and data processing.
  - **Responsive Design:** Added CSS styling for URL input fields with proper icon positioning, hover effects, and mobile-friendly responsive behavior.
  - **Cross-Page Compatibility:** Implemented robust null safety checks in JavaScript functions to prevent errors when URL input elements don't exist on certain pages, ensuring seamless operation across different page contexts.
  - **Error Resolution:** Fixed TypeError issues in edit modal functionality by adding comprehensive null checks for URL field access, ensuring stable operation when switching between different modal implementations.
  - **User Experience:** Users can now choose between file uploads, external URLs, or a combination of both, providing maximum flexibility for different document management workflows and storage preferences across all warranty management interfaces.
  - _Files: `backend/migrations/043_add_document_urls_to_warranties.sql`, `backend/warranties_routes.py`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/status.html`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/style.css`_

- **Database Port Configuration Support:** Added support for custom database port configuration via the `DB_PORT` environment variable to enhance deployment flexibility. The implementation is fully backward-compatible, defaulting to port 5432 if the variable is not set.
  - **Backend Integration:** Updated `backend/db_handler.py` and `backend/fix_permissions.py` to recognize and use the `DB_PORT` environment variable in all database connection calls.
  - **Docker Support:** Added `DB_PORT` environment variable support to both `docker-compose.yml` files with fallback defaults (`${DB_PORT:-5432}`).
  - **Configuration Examples:** Updated `env.example` with commented DB_PORT configuration option for local development guidance.
  - **Deployment Flexibility:** Users can now customize database ports for non-standard PostgreSQL deployments, multi-instance setups, or specific infrastructure requirements.
  - _Files: `backend/db_handler.py`, `backend/fix_permissions.py`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Docker/docker-compose.yml`, `env.example`_

- **Warranty Claims Tracking System:** Introduced comprehensive warranty claims management functionality allowing users to track and manage warranty claims for their products throughout the entire claim lifecycle.
  - **Database Schema:** Added `warranty_claims` table via migration 044 with support for claim dates, status tracking, claim numbers, descriptions, resolutions, and resolution dates with proper foreign key relationships and indexing.
  - **Backend API:** Implemented full REST API for claims management including endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting warranty claims with proper authentication and authorization checks.
  - **Frontend Integration:** Added intuitive claims modal interface accessible from warranty cards with comprehensive claim management features including status tracking, date management, and detailed claim information.
  - **Status Management:** Implemented claim status workflow with predefined statuses (Submitted, In Progress, Approved, Denied, Resolved, Cancelled) and proper status badge styling for visual clarity.
  - **Date Handling:** Enhanced date formatting and display logic to properly handle claim dates, resolution dates, and warranty expiration dates with robust null value handling and user-friendly formatting.
  - **User Interface:** Positioned Claims button as the first action button in warranty card headers (Claims, Edit, Delete order) with hover tooltip for easy identification and access.
  - **Modal Behavior:** Enhanced claims modal stability by preventing accidental closure when clicking outside the modal area, requiring explicit close button interaction for better user experience.
  - **Data Integrity:** Implemented proper validation, error handling, and database constraints to ensure data consistency and prevent orphaned records.

## 0.10.1.9 - 2025-08-24

### Fixed
- **Critical Apprise Notification Fixes - RESOLVED ✅:** Successfully resolved five critical issues that were preventing scheduled Apprise notifications from being sent:
  - **Configuration Reload Issue:** Added `apprise_handler.reload_configuration()` call in scheduled notification process to ensure the handler uses the latest settings from the database instead of stale startup configuration. This fixes the issue where enabling Apprise via the UI wouldn't trigger scheduled notifications.
  - **Data Fetching Logic Issue:** Removed restrictive `email_notifications` filter from the `get_expiring_warranties` SQL query that was preventing Apprise-only users from receiving notifications. The query now correctly fetches expiring warranties for all active users regardless of their notification channel preference.
  - **Notification Dispatch Logic Issue:** Completely refactored the `send_expiration_notifications` function to properly separate email and Apprise notification logic. The previous implementation failed to pass warranty data to the Apprise handler even when users were correctly identified as eligible. The new implementation uses dedicated helper functions (`is_notification_due`, `process_email_notifications`, `process_apprise_notifications`) that ensure warranty data flows correctly to both notification channels.
  - **Handler Scope Issue:** Fixed the issue where the scheduled notification process was checking a local, uninitialized `apprise_handler` variable instead of the properly configured handler from the Flask application context. Modified `process_apprise_notifications()` to retrieve the handler using `current_app.config.get('APPRISE_HANDLER')`, ensuring the scheduler uses the same fully initialized instance as the rest of the application.
  - **Application Context Issue:** Fixed the final critical issue where the background scheduler was executing jobs outside of the Flask application context, causing "Working outside of application context" errors. Modified `init_scheduler()` to accept the Flask app instance and wrap the scheduled job with `app.app_context()`, ensuring the background task has access to all application configurations and services. Updated all calls to `init_scheduler()` in `backend/__init__.py` and `backend/app.py` to pass the app object.
  - **✅ VERIFICATION COMPLETE:** All fixes have been successfully implemented and tested. Scheduled Apprise notifications now work correctly for users configured with "Apprise only" or "Both" notification channels. The notification system is fully operational, production-ready, and follows Flask best practices for background task integration. Email notifications remain unaffected and continue to work as expected.
  - _Files: `backend/notifications.py`, `backend/__init__.py`, `backend/app.py`_

- **Email Configuration Enhancement:** Added support for `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS` environment variable to allow customization of the email From address independently of the SMTP username. This provides better flexibility for email configuration, especially when using email services where the authentication username differs from the desired sender address. ([#115](https://github.com/clmcavaney/warracker/pull/115))
  - _Files: `backend/notifications.py`_

- **Critical Fix for Duplicate Scheduled Notifications:** Fixed critical issue where multiple identical notifications were being sent in 'optimized' and 'performance' modes due to multiple worker processes each running their own notification scheduler. The `should_run_scheduler()` function contained flawed logic with unsafe defaults that allowed multiple workers to incorrectly identify as the primary worker, leading to redundant schedulers and duplicate notifications.
  - **Root Cause:** The function had multiple problematic fallback conditions including defaulting `GUNICORN_WORKER_ID` to '0' when not set, causing all workers to think they were the primary worker.
  - **Solution:** Simplified and strengthened the logic to only allow worker ID '0' to run the scheduler, with no unsafe fallbacks. The function now strictly checks for `GUNICORN_WORKER_ID == '0'` and defaults to not running the scheduler if the worker ID cannot be determined.
  - **Impact:** Users will now receive exactly one notification per scheduled event regardless of the memory mode (ultra-light, optimized, or performance). System efficiency is improved by eliminating redundant background processes.
  - _Files: `backend/notifications.py`_

- **Critical Fix for Scheduler Database Connection Handling:** Fixed critical issue where scheduled notifications were failing due to stale database connections that timed out between job executions, causing "server closed the connection unexpectedly" errors. The background scheduler was attempting to reuse database connections that had been closed by the server, preventing the notification process from fetching users and warranties.
  - **Root Cause:** The scheduled job was not properly managing database connection lifecycle, leading to attempts to use stale connections that had timed out between job runs.
  - **Solution:** Refactored the `send_expiration_notifications()` function to acquire a fresh database connection at the start of each job execution and ensure its proper release in a try/finally block. The connection is now managed for the entire job duration, preventing stale connection issues.
  - **Impact:** Scheduled notifications (both Email and Apprise) now execute reliably without database connection errors. The notification system is more stable and robust for long-running background processes.
  - _Files: `backend/notifications.py`_

- **Definitive Fix for Notification Scheduler Logic Across All Memory Modes:** Fixed critical issue where the notification scheduler logic was not robust enough to handle all Gunicorn memory modes, resulting in either no notifications in single-worker mode ('ultra-light') or potential issues in multi-worker modes. The `should_run_scheduler()` function failed to properly distinguish between single-worker and multi-worker environments.
  - **Root Cause:** The function incorrectly treated the absence of `GUNICORN_WORKER_ID` environment variable as a reason to NOT run the scheduler, when in single-worker mode this variable is not set and the scheduler should run.
  - **Solution:** Implemented explicit logic to handle two distinct cases: (1) Multi-worker environment where `worker_id` is set - only worker '0' runs scheduler, (2) Single-worker environment where `worker_id` is None - the single worker must run the scheduler.
  - **Impact:** The notification scheduler now works reliably across all memory modes: 'ultra-light' (single worker), 'optimized' (2 workers), and 'performance' (4 workers). Exactly one scheduler instance runs regardless of configuration, ensuring consistent notification delivery.
  - _Files: `backend/notifications.py`_

## 0.10.1.8 - 2025-07-22

### Fixed
- **Notification System Initialization:** Fixed critical issue where warranty expiration notifications were not working due to scheduler initialization failures in Docker ultra-light mode.
  - **Root Cause:** The notification scheduler initialization code was located in `backend/app.py` but Gunicorn was using the application factory pattern from `backend/__init__.py`, causing the scheduler to never be initialized. Additionally, the scheduler detection logic incorrectly identified single-worker ultra-light mode as multi-worker, preventing scheduler startup. Missing API endpoints `/api/timezones` and `/api/locales` were causing frontend errors and preventing proper settings configuration.
  - **Solution:** Moved scheduler initialization into the `create_app()` factory function to ensure it runs during application startup. Enhanced `should_run_scheduler()` detection logic to properly handle ultra-light mode with single sync worker. Added missing `/api/timezones` endpoint returning timezone data grouped by region (including America/Halifax) and `/api/locales` endpoint returning supported languages. Fixed timezone API to return array format expected by frontend and removed authentication requirement from locales endpoint for public access. Implemented comprehensive memory mode compatibility ensuring scheduler works correctly across all deployment configurations.
  - **Impact:** Notification scheduler now properly initializes and runs in all Docker memory modes (ultra-light, optimized, and performance). In multi-worker modes, only worker-0 runs the scheduler to prevent conflicts and resource waste. Automatic warranty expiration notifications work correctly, checking every 2 minutes for warranties to notify about. Settings page timezone and language dropdowns now load properly. Admin "Check Scheduler Status" button shows `scheduler_running: true` and active notification jobs. Manual notification testing via admin panel now functions correctly across all memory configurations.
  - _Files: `backend/__init__.py`, `backend/notifications.py`, `backend/warranties_routes.py`_

- **Mobile Button Text Overflow:** Fixed an issue where the "Manage Tags" button text would overflow on smaller mobile screens. The text is now hidden on screens narrower than 480px, showing only the icon to save space.
  - _Files: `frontend/mobile-header.css`_

  - **Mobile List View Optimization:** Fixed oversized warranty cards in list view on mobile browsers that were causing poor user experience with excessive scrolling and large interface elements.
  - **Root Cause:** The list view was using desktop-sized elements on mobile devices, including 180px × 180px product images, excessive padding, and large text that made warranty cards too large for mobile viewports.
  - **Solution:** Implemented comprehensive mobile-specific CSS optimizations with progressive size reduction across different screen sizes. Added responsive image sizing (80px → 60px → 50px for 768px → 480px → 360px screens), reduced card spacing and padding, optimized text and icon sizes, changed warranty info layout from horizontal to vertical on mobile, and disabled hover transforms that caused layout jumping on touch devices.
  - **Impact:** Warranty cards in list view are now significantly more compact and mobile-friendly. Users can now comfortably browse warranties on mobile devices without excessive scrolling. The interface adapts progressively to different mobile screen sizes while maintaining full functionality and readability.
  - _Files: `frontend/mobile-header.css`, `frontend/style.css`_

## 0.10.1.7  - 2025-07-20

### Fixed
- **Configuration Precedence Fix:** Fixed critical issue where environment variables were being ignored in favor of database settings on fresh installations, preventing proper configuration of OIDC, Apprise, and email settings via environment variables.
  - **Root Cause:** The configuration loading logic was checking database settings first, and since migration scripts insert default values (e.g., `oidc_enabled: 'false'`), the code would use these database values instead of checking environment variables. This violated the expected precedence hierarchy and made it impossible to configure the application via `.env` files on fresh deployments. Additionally, the `/api/auth/oidc-status` endpoint was not using the same precedence logic, causing the frontend to show "SSO is not enabled" even when users configured OIDC in the GUI but had conflicting environment variables.
  - **Solution:** Updated configuration loading in `init_oidc_client()`, `_load_configuration()`, email base URL handling, and OIDC status endpoint to follow proper precedence: Environment Variable > Database Setting > Hardcoded Default. Fixed all OIDC settings (`OIDC_ENABLED`, `OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`, `OIDC_SCOPE`), all Apprise settings (`APPRISE_ENABLED`, `APPRISE_URLS`, `APPRISE_EXPIRATION_DAYS`, `APPRISE_NOTIFICATION_TIME`, `APPRISE_TITLE_PREFIX`), and email base URL (`APP_BASE_URL`) to check environment variables first using proper `if env_var is not None:` logic. Updated the `get_oidc_status_route()` function to apply the same precedence logic as the backend initialization.
  - **Impact:** Environment variables now take precedence over database settings as expected. Fresh installations can be properly configured using Docker `.env` files. OIDC SSO, Apprise notifications, and email links now work correctly when configured via environment variables. The frontend SSO button now correctly reflects the actual OIDC configuration state. Existing deployments using database settings continue to work unchanged.
  - _Files: `backend/__init__.py`, `backend/apprise_handler.py`, `backend/auth_routes.py`, `backend/notifications.py`, `backend/oidc_handler.py`_

- **PostgreSQL Migration Permission Fix:** Fixed migration failures on standard PostgreSQL user setups that don't have `CREATEROLE` privileges, preventing application startup with error "keine Berechtigung, um Rolle zu ändern" (no permission to alter role).
  - **Root Cause:** Migrations `009z_grant_createrole_to_db_user.sql`, `010_configure_admin_roles.sql`, and `011_ensure_admin_permissions.sql` were attempting to grant `CREATEROLE` privileges and create admin roles, but these operations require superuser or `CREATEROLE` privileges that standard database users don't have. This caused migration failures on secure, standard PostgreSQL setups.
  - **Solution:** Updated all role management migrations to use PostgreSQL `DO` blocks with exception handling. The migrations now attempt advanced role operations but gracefully continue with informative notices if permissions are insufficient. Core application functionality is preserved while optional advanced features are skipped when permissions don't allow them.
  - **Impact:** Applications can now successfully start and run on standard PostgreSQL user setups without requiring elevated database privileges. The application works fully with basic user permissions while optional role management features are gracefully disabled when not available. Migration errors no longer prevent application startup.
  - _Files: `backend/migrations/009z_grant_createrole_to_db_user.sql`, `backend/migrations/010_configure_admin_roles.sql`, `backend/migrations/011_ensure_admin_permissions.sql`_
  
- **Warranty Routes Refactoring:** Extracted all warranty-related functionality from main application file into dedicated Flask Blueprint for improved code organization and maintainability.
  - **Root Cause:** Warranty routes were contained within the main `app.py` file, making the codebase monolithic and harder to maintain as the application grew.
  - **Solution:** Created new `warranties_routes.py` Blueprint containing all 9 warranty routes including CRUD operations, CSV import, global view, and tag management. Updated route decorators from `@app.route()` to `@warranties_bp.route()`, registered blueprint with `/api` prefix, and resolved import issues for both Docker and development environments.
  - **Impact:** Reduced main application file by ~1,500 lines of code while maintaining 100% API compatibility. Warranty functionality is now properly isolated in a 1,589-line dedicated module, making future maintenance and feature development easier.

- **Admin Routes Refactoring:** Extracted all administrative functionality from main application file into dedicated Flask Blueprint for improved code organization and maintainability.
  - **Root Cause:** Admin routes were scattered throughout the main `app.py` file, making the codebase harder to maintain and reducing code modularity.
  - **Solution:** Created new `admin_routes.py` Blueprint containing all 16 admin routes including user management, site settings, notifications, and Apprise integration. Updated route decorators from `@app.route()` to `@admin_bp.route()`, registered blueprint with `/api/admin` prefix, and ensured proper import handling for both Docker and development environments.
  - **Impact:** Reduced main application file by ~635 lines of code while maintaining 100% API compatibility. Admin functionality is now properly isolated and modularized, making future maintenance and feature development easier.
  - _Files: `backend/admin_routes.py` (new), `backend/app.py`, `Dockerfile`_

- **Statistics Routes Refactoring:** Extracted statistics functionality from main application file into dedicated Flask Blueprint for improved code organization and maintainability.
  - **Root Cause:** Statistics routes were embedded within the main `app.py` file, contributing to a monolithic codebase structure.
  - **Solution:** Created new `statistics_routes.py` Blueprint containing both statistics routes (`/api/statistics` and `/api/statistics/global`) along with the `convert_decimals()` helper function. Updated route decorators from `@app.route()` to `@statistics_bp.route()`, registered blueprint with `/api` prefix, and ensured proper import handling for both Docker and development environments.
  - **Impact:** Reduced main application file by ~390 lines of code while maintaining 100% API compatibility. Statistics functionality is now properly isolated, ensuring Status page dashboard continues working seamlessly.
  - _Files: `backend/statistics_routes.py` (new), `backend/app.py`, `Dockerfile`_

- **Tag Management Routes Refactoring:** Extracted all tag management functionality from main application files into dedicated Flask Blueprint for improved code organization and maintainability.
  - **Root Cause:** Tag management routes were scattered across multiple files (`app.py` and `warranties_routes.py`), making tag-related functionality harder to maintain and reducing code modularity.
  - **Solution:** Created new `tags_routes.py` Blueprint containing all 6 tag-related routes including direct tag management (`/api/tags` CRUD operations) and warranty-tag association (`/api/warranties/{id}/tags`). Updated route decorators from `@app.route()` and `@warranties_bp.route()` to `@tags_bp.route()`, registered blueprint with `/api` prefix, and ensured proper import handling for both Docker and development environments.
  - **Impact:** Reduced main application files by ~323 lines of code while maintaining 100% API compatibility. Tag functionality is now properly consolidated in a single 336-line dedicated module, making tag management operations easier to maintain and extend.
  - _Files: `backend/tags_routes.py` (new), `backend/app.py`, `backend/warranties_routes.py`, `Dockerfile`_

- **File Handling Routes Refactoring:** Extracted all file handling and Paperless-ngx integration functionality from main application file into dedicated Flask Blueprint for improved code organization and maintainability.
  - **Root Cause:** File handling routes and Paperless-ngx integration were embedded within the main `app.py` file, contributing to a monolithic codebase structure and making file-related functionality harder to maintain.
  - **Solution:** Created new `file_routes.py` Blueprint containing all 13 file-related routes including local file serving (`/api/files/<path:filename>`, `/api/secure-file/<path:filename>`, `/api/paperless-file/<int:paperless_id>`) and Paperless-ngx integration (`/api/paperless/upload`, `/api/paperless/test`, `/api/paperless/search`, `/api/paperless/tags`, `/api/paperless/debug`, `/api/paperless/test-upload`, `/api/paperless/debug-document/<int:document_id>`, `/api/paperless/cleanup-invalid`, `/api/paperless-search-and-link`, `/api/paperless/url`). Created shared `utils.py` module with `allowed_file()` function. Updated route decorators from `@app.route()` to `@file_bp.route()`, registered blueprint with `/api` prefix, and cleaned up unused imports (`secure_filename`, `send_from_directory`, `mimetypes`).
  - **Impact:** Reduced main application file by ~781 lines of code (from 1,769 to 988 lines) while maintaining 100% API compatibility. File handling and Paperless-ngx functionality is now properly isolated in a 933-line dedicated module, making file operations and third-party integrations easier to maintain and extend.
  - _Files: `backend/file_routes.py` (new), `backend/utils.py` (new), `backend/app.py`, `backend/warranties_routes.py`, `Dockerfile`_

- **Application Factory Pattern Implementation:** Implemented Flask Application Factory Pattern to transform the application architecture from a monolithic script to a professional, modular, and testable structure following Flask community best practices.
  - **Root Cause:** The application used a global Flask app object created at import time, making it difficult to test, configure for different environments, and maintain as the codebase grew. Configuration was scattered throughout `app.py`, extensions were initialized directly in the main module, and the application couldn't be easily instantiated for testing purposes.
  - **Solution:** Created centralized `config.py` with environment-specific configuration classes (Development, Production, Testing), unified `extensions.py` module for Flask extension initialization with lazy loading pattern, implemented `create_app()` factory function in `__init__.py` for on-demand application creation, and simplified `app.py` to a 42-line entry point that uses the factory. Updated Dockerfile to use `gunicorn "backend:create_app()"` command and fixed blueprint imports to use extensions module instead of the old app module.
  - **Impact:** Reduced main application file by ~1,101 lines of code (from 1,143 to 42 lines) while maintaining 100% API compatibility. Application now supports multiple environments (development/production/testing), can be easily tested with isolated app instances, follows Flask best practices with proper extension management, and provides a clean separation of concerns between configuration, extensions, application creation, and entry point logic.
  - _Files: `backend/config.py` (new), `backend/extensions.py` (enhanced), `backend/__init__.py` (enhanced), `backend/app.py` (simplified), `backend/auth_routes.py` (import fix), `Dockerfile`_

- **Missing API Endpoints After Refactoring:** Restored critical API endpoints that were accidentally removed during the Application Factory Pattern implementation, causing 404 errors in the frontend.
  - **Root Cause:** During the blueprint refactoring, two essential endpoints (`/api/currencies` and `/api/settings/global-view-status`) were removed from the application, causing the frontend to fail when loading currency data and checking global view permissions.
  - **Solution:** Added missing `/api/currencies` endpoint to `warranties_routes.py` returning comprehensive list of 85+ world currencies with symbols, codes, and names. Added missing `/api/settings/global-view-status` endpoint to `statistics_routes.py` to check global view permissions based on user admin status and site settings. Updated frontend currency loading functions in `script.js` and `settings-new.js` to include authentication tokens in requests.
  - **Impact:** Resolved 404 errors preventing currency dropdown population and global view functionality. Frontend now properly loads currency data and global view permissions with proper authentication.
  - _Files: `backend/warranties_routes.py`, `backend/statistics_routes.py`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/settings-new.js`_

- **Status Page Warranty Details Functionality:** Fixed status page warranty detail expansion that was failing due to missing API endpoint and frontend JavaScript errors.
  - **Root Cause:** The status page was attempting to fetch detailed warranty information from `/api/debug/warranty/{id}` endpoint that didn't exist, and the toast notification system had a null reference error when trying to add event listeners.
  - **Solution:** Added new `/api/debug/warranty/<int:warranty_id>` GET endpoint in `warranties_routes.py` that returns complete warranty details including serial numbers, tags, and user information with proper permission checks. Fixed toast function in `status.js` to safely check for element existence before adding event listeners. Enhanced status page to display both local and Paperless-ngx documents with proper visual indicators.
  - **Impact:** Status page warranty rows now expand properly when clicked, showing detailed warranty information, documents, and serial numbers. Toast notifications work without JavaScript errors.
  - _Files: `backend/warranties_routes.py`, `frontend/status.js`_

- **Paperless-ngx Document Visibility on Warranty Cards:** Fixed issue where documents added from Paperless-ngx weren't appearing on warranty cards in the main view, despite being properly stored and visible in edit modals.
  - **Root Cause:** The frontend logic for determining whether to show the document links section (`hasDocuments` calculation) only checked for local file paths but ignored Paperless-ngx document IDs. Status page document display also only showed local files.
  - **Solution:** Enhanced `hasDocuments` calculation in `script.js` to include Paperless-ngx document IDs (`paperless_invoice_id`, `paperless_manual_id`, `paperless_photo_id`, `paperless_other_id`) alongside local file paths. Updated status page document display logic to show both local and Paperless-ngx documents with cloud icon indicators. Exposed `openPaperlessDocument` and `openSecureFile` functions to window object for global access.
  - **Impact:** Warranty cards now properly display document links when Paperless-ngx documents are attached. Users can access both local files and Paperless-ngx documents from warranty cards and status page, with visual distinction between storage types.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/status.js`_

## 0.10.1.6  - 2025-07-13

### Fixed
- **Warranty Card Layout Improvement:** Moved warranty status row to the bottom of warranty cards in both grid and list views for better visual hierarchy and consistent card structure.
  - **Root Cause:** Status information appeared in the middle of warranty cards, breaking visual flow.
  - **Solution:** Relocated warranty status row to appear after document links and tags at the bottom of each card.
  - **Impact:** Improved card readability and consistent layout across all view modes.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_

- **Tag Management Real-Time Updates:** Fixed issue where tag changes (color updates, name changes) in the manage tags modal did not immediately reflect in warranty cards and UI elements.
  - **Root Cause:** Tag updates only refreshed the management modal but not the main warranty display or related UI components.
  - **Solution:** Enhanced updateTag() and deleteTag() functions to update all UI elements including warranty cards, selected tags, filter dropdowns, and edit forms.
  - **Impact:** Tag changes now appear instantly throughout the application without requiring page refresh.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_

- **Missing Tag-Related Translations:** Resolved issue where tag management success and error messages displayed as translation keys instead of localized text across all supported languages.
  - **Root Cause:** Tag-related message keys (tag_updated_successfully, tag_created_successfully, etc.) were missing from translation files.
  - **Solution:** Added complete set of tag management translations to all 17 language files including success messages, error messages, and validation text.
  - **Impact:** Users now see properly localized tag management messages in their preferred language.
  - **Languages Updated:** English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Czech, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese (Simplified & Traditional), Hindi, Arabic, Persian, Ukrainian.
  - _Files: All `locales/*/translation.json` files_

- **Update Caching Issues:** Resolved errors during application updates caused by browser and service worker caching of outdated assets.
  - Configured `nginx.conf` with no-cache headers for `sw.js` to ensure fresh service worker loads on updates.
  - Updated service worker cache name in `frontend/sw.js` to 'warracker-cache-v20250119001' and added version parameters to all cached assets.
  - Incremented version query parameters (?v=20250119001) across all HTML files to force cache busting for CSS, JS, and other assets.
  - Temporarily added version parameter to service worker registration in `frontend/script.js`, removed after nginx configuration handles it going forward.
  - Verified complete removal of previous version strings and consistent application across all frontend files.

- **Database Migration Format String Errors:** Fixed critical migration failures preventing new Warracker instances from starting up due to PostgreSQL parameter format string conflicts in migration files.
  - **Root Cause:** Migration files `011_ensure_admin_permissions.sql` and `031_add_owner_role.sql` contained mixed parameter format styles that caused psycopg2 to fail with "argument formats can't be mixed" and "too many parameters specified for RAISE" errors. The issue occurred when Python-style parameter placeholders (`%(db_user)s`) were mixed with PostgreSQL format specifiers (`%`) in `RAISE NOTICE` statements within the same SQL file.
  - **Solution:** Fixed format string conflicts in `011_ensure_admin_permissions.sql` by escaping literal `%` characters as `%%` in `RAISE NOTICE` statements to avoid conflicts with Python parameter substitution. Fixed parameter count issues in `031_add_owner_role.sql` by correcting `RAISE NOTICE` statements to use proper single `%` for parameter placeholders instead of double `%%` which was causing parameter count mismatches.
  - **Impact:** New Warracker instances can now start up successfully without migration failures. All 42 database migrations (000 through 042) now complete successfully, allowing proper creation of the `site_settings` table and elimination of "relation 'site_settings' does not exist" errors during startup.
  - _Files: `backend/migrations/011_ensure_admin_permissions.sql`, `backend/migrations/031_add_owner_role.sql`_

_Files: `nginx.conf`, `frontend/sw.js`, `frontend/script.js`, all frontend HTML files (index.html, status.html, settings-new.html, login.html, register.html, reset-password-request.html, reset-password.html, about.html, auth-redirect.html, debug-export.html)_

- **Docker Compose Command Duplication Fix:** Resolved update issues by removing redundant migration and permission commands from the root `docker-compose.yml`, preventing duplicated execution and startup errors.

_Files: `docker-compose.yml`_

- **Flexible Date Parsing in CSV Import:** Enhanced CSV import to support multiple date formats for the PurchaseDate field using dateutil.parser, removing the strict YYYY-MM-DD requirement.
  - **Root Cause:** Import required exact YYYY-MM-DD format, failing on other common formats.
  - **Solution:** Replaced strict datetime.strptime with flexible dateutil.parser.parse in backend/app.py.
  - **Impact:** Users can now import warranties with various date formats without manual reformatting.
  - _Files: `backend/app.py`_

- **Warranty Duration Selection Limit:** Fixed limitation preventing selection above 11 months for warranty durations. Removed backend validation caps on months (<12) and days (<366), increased years limit to 999, and updated frontend input maximums to 999 months and 9999 days for flexible entry. Added migration to adjust database constraints accordingly.
  - _Files: `backend/app.py`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/status.html`, `backend/migrations/042_allow_higher_duration_components.sql`_
- **Paperless-ngx Duplicate Document Handling:** Added detection of duplicate documents during upload to Paperless-ngx. When a duplicate is found, the system automatically links to the existing document and displays an informative message to the user.
  - **Root Cause:** Previous implementation did not check for duplicates before upload, leading to generic error messages.
  - **Solution:** Added checksum-based duplicate check before upload in backend/paperless_handler.py and handled linking in frontend/script.js.
  - **Impact:** Users now get clear feedback about duplicates and automatic linking instead of upload failures.
  - _Files: `backend/paperless_handler.py`, `backend/app.py`, `frontend/script.js`_

  - **Database Migration Permission Fix:** Resolved 'no permission to create role' errors during initial setup by granting CREATEROLE privilege to the db_user in a new early migration and removing duplicate grants in later migrations. This ensures smooth database initialization without requiring superuser privileges.
  - _Files: `backend/migrations/009z_grant_createrole_to_db_user.sql`, `backend/migrations/011_ensure_admin_permissions.sql`_

- **Missing Translation for Warranty Addition Success Message:** Resolved issue where the success message displayed as a placeholder key ('messages.warranty_added_successfully') instead of the translated text.
  - Added the key and appropriate translations to all supported languages in `translation.json` files.
  - Updated English and French `.po` files for backend consistency.
  - Ensures proper localized success messages appear when adding warranties in any language.

  _Files: All `locales/*/translation.json`, `locales/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`, `locales/fr/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`_

- **Product Photo Loading Fix:** Fixed issue where product photos would disappear when navigating between pages, specifically when returning from the status page to the homepage.
  - **Root Cause:** The renderWarranties function was calling a non-existent `initializeSecureImages()` function, causing JavaScript errors that prevented secure image loading.
  - **Solution:** Replaced the incorrect `initializeSecureImages()` function call with the correct `loadSecureImages()` function.
  - **Impact:** Product photos now load consistently across all page navigation scenarios with proper authentication.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_

## 0.10.1.5  - 2025-07-08

### Enhanced

### Fixed

- **Paperless-ngx Auto-Linking After Add Warranty:** Fixed an issue where uploading invoices or manuals to Paperless-ngx when adding a new warranty did not automatically link the documents to the warranty (auto-link/search logic was not triggered). Now, after adding a warranty, any uploaded Paperless-ngx documents (invoice or manual) are automatically searched and linked, matching the behavior of the edit warranty modal. This works for both invoices and manuals, provided their storage is set to "paperless".
  - **Root Cause:** The auto-link logic was running after the form reset, which cleared file inputs and prevented document linking.
  - **Solution:** The auto-link logic now runs before the form reset, using pre-upload file info and storage type to ensure correct document association.
  - **Impact:** Users can now add warranties and have their uploaded Paperless-ngx invoices/manuals automatically linked, just like in the edit modal.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_

- **Toast Error Adding Warranty:** When skipping a missing field in a form, the application now displays only a single warning message instead of multiple repeated warnings. This improves user experience by preventing redundant alerts when required fields are missing or skipped.

  - _Files: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/script.js`_

  - **Persistent View Scope (Global/Personal) with Auto-Loading:** The app now remembers the user's last selected view scope (global or personal) and automatically loads the correct data from the appropriate API endpoint on page load, not just updating the UI.
  - **Seamless Experience:** Users no longer need to re-select their preferred view after a refresh; the correct data and UI are loaded immediately based on their last choice.
  - **Consistent State:** Both the main warranties page and the status dashboard respect the saved preference and fetch from the correct endpoint (`/api/warranties/global` or `/api/warranties`, and `/api/statistics/global` or `/api/statistics`).
  - **User-Specific Storage:** Preferences are stored per user/admin using the same prefix system as other settings.
  - **Robustness:** The system defaults to personal view if no preference is found or on error, and always keeps the UI and data in sync.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/status.js`_

- **Authentication System Refactoring to Flask Blueprints:** Complete restructuring of authentication routes for improved code organization and maintainability.
  - **Flask Blueprint Architecture:** Migrated all authentication routes from the monolithic `app.py` file to a dedicated Flask Blueprint (`auth_routes.py`)
  - **Modular Code Organization:** Separated authentication logic into specialized modules:
    - **`auth_utils.py`:** Authentication helper functions (`generate_token`, `decode_token`, `token_required`, `admin_required`, `is_valid_email`, `is_valid_password`)
    - **`auth_routes.py`:** Authentication Blueprint containing all auth-related routes and handlers

  - _Files: `frontend/style.css`, `frontend/script.js`_

### Fixed
- **CSV Import Currency Selection:** Fixed CSV import functionality that was incorrectly defaulting all imported warranties to USD currency instead of using the user's preferred currency from settings.
  - **Root Cause:** CSV import function in `backend/app.py` was hardcoding `'USD'` for all imported warranties regardless of user preferences
  - **Solution:** Enhanced import function to query user's preferred currency symbol from `user_preferences` table and convert it to appropriate currency code
  - **Currency Mapping:** Implemented comprehensive symbol-to-code mapping for 30+ currencies (€→EUR, £→GBP, ¥→JPY, etc.) matching frontend logic
  - **Intelligent Fallback:** Graceful fallback to USD for users without currency preferences or with unknown custom symbols
  - **Enhanced Logging:** Added detailed logging to track currency preference detection and assignment during import process
  - **Result:** Imported warranties now automatically use user's preferred currency (Euro, Pound, Yen, etc.) instead of always defaulting to USD
  - _Files: `backend/app.py`_

- **Export Function Debugging and Verification:** Resolved user reports of incomplete warranty exports by implementing comprehensive debugging tools and verifying export functionality
  - **Root Cause Analysis:** Determined that export function was working correctly - all warranties were being exported as expected
  - **Debug Implementation:** Added detailed console logging to export process showing step-by-step filter application and final export counts
  - **Verification Tools:** Created interactive debug page (`frontend/debug-export.html`) and backend debug API (`/api/debug/export`) for troubleshooting
  - **User Education:** Identified that perceived "missing" records were due to CSV viewer display issues with similar/duplicate entries rather than export functionality problems
  - **Export Validation:** Confirmed all warranties are properly included in CSV output with correct data formatting and structure
  - **Documentation:** Enhanced export process with real-time feedback showing actual number of warranties exported

- **Critical User Preferences Persistence Bug:** Fixed date format and currency symbol settings not saving properly, causing user preferences to revert to defaults after page refresh.
  - **Root Cause:** Backend API endpoints (`GET`/`PUT` `/api/auth/preferences`) were hardcoded to always return `currency_symbol: '$'` and `date_format: 'MDY'` instead of reading from/writing to the database columns
  - **Database Verification:** Confirmed both `currency_symbol` and `date_format` columns exist in `user_preferences` table via migrations `006_add_currency_symbol_column.py` and `019_add_date_format_column.sql`
  - **Backend API Fixes (`backend/auth_routes.py`):**
    - **GET Route:** Added `currency_symbol, date_format` to SELECT queries and updated response mapping to use actual database values
    - **PUT Route:** Added validation and processing for `currency_symbol` and `date_format` from request data
    - **UPDATE Query:** Enhanced to include currency symbol and date format in SET clauses
    - **INSERT Query:** Updated to save currency symbol and date format for new user preferences
    - **Response Consistency:** All preference responses now return actual saved values instead of hardcoded defaults
  - **Validation Added:** Currency symbol limited to 8 characters, date format restricted to valid options (`MDY`, `DMY`, `YMD`, `MDY_WORDS`, `DMY_WORDS`, `YMD_WORDS`)
  - **Result:** Settings page now properly persists currency symbol (€, £, ¥, etc.) and date format preferences across page refreshes and sessions
  - _Files: `backend/auth_routes.py`_

- **Critical OIDC Login RecursionError Fix:** Resolved fatal `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded` preventing OIDC authentication with self-hosted providers like Authentik.
  - **Root Cause:** Gunicorn's `gevent` worker type needs to monkey-patch standard libraries (like `ssl`) before they're imported, but `preload_app = True` was loading Flask dependencies before patching occurred
  - **Solution:** Enhanced `gunicorn_config.py` with conditional early monkey patching that occurs at the very beginning of the configuration file, before any other imports
  - **Intelligent Patching:** Monkey patching now only applies to memory modes that use gevent workers (`optimized` and `performance`), while `ultra-light` mode with sync workers skips patching entirely
  - **Safety:** Uses try/catch block to gracefully handle environments without gevent installed, ensuring no impact on sync workers or development environments
  - **Result:** OIDC providers now work correctly with gevent workers, eliminating SSL recursion errors and enabling SSO functionality across all deployment modes
  - **Verification:** MonkeyPatchWarning no longer appears in startup logs, replaced with "✅ Early gevent monkey patch applied for SSL compatibility" confirmation
  - _Files: `backend/gunicorn_config.py`_

- **Critical OIDC HTTPS Callback URL Fix:** Resolved OIDC login failures when Warracker is accessed over HTTPS, where the application was generating incorrect `http://` callback URLs instead of `https://` URLs.
  - **Root Cause:** Flask application running behind Nginx reverse proxy was not aware of the original HTTPS protocol, causing `url_for(_external=True)` to generate HTTP callback URLs that didn't match the OIDC provider's expected HTTPS URLs
  - **Reverse Proxy Configuration:** While Nginx correctly sent `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` headers, Gunicorn and Flask were not configured to trust and use these forwarded headers
  - **Gunicorn Fix (`backend/gunicorn_config.py`):** Added `forwarded_allow_ips = '*'` configuration to trust proxy headers from the containerized Nginx reverse proxy
  - **Flask Middleware (`backend/app.py`):** Implemented `ProxyFix` middleware with `x_for=1, x_proto=1, x_host=1, x_prefix=1` to read forwarded headers and update Flask's request context
  - **Header Processing:** Flask now correctly interprets `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers and generates HTTPS URLs when accessed through the reverse proxy
  - **Result:** OIDC login flow now generates correct `https://warracker.domain.com/api/oidc/callback` URLs, eliminating provider callback mismatches and enabling successful SSO authentication over HTTPS
  - **Standard Practice:** Implements industry-standard reverse proxy configuration for Flask applications behind SSL-terminating proxies
  - _Files: `backend/gunicorn_config.py`, `backend/app.py`_

    - **Scope Description:** Real-time description updates explaining which warranties will be included in notifications
    - **Settings Persistence:** Warranty scope preference saved to backend and properly loaded with other Apprise settings
    - **Event Handling:** Immediate UI feedback when changing warranty scope selection
  - **Flexible Combinations:** Works seamlessly with notification modes for complete control:
    - **Global + All:** Single notification with all users' warranties (original behavior)
    - **Global + Admin:** Single notification with only admin's warranties
    - **Individual + All:** Separate notifications sent to each user with their warranties
    - **Individual + Admin:** Notification sent only to admin with their warranties
  - **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback to 'all' scope if admin user cannot be determined, with appropriate logging

  - _Files: `backend/auth_routes.py`, `frontend/settings-new.html`, `frontend/settings-new.js`_

- **Apprise Notification Message Format Standardization:** Unified notification message format between scheduled and manual Apprise notifications for consistency.
  - **Message Format Alignment (`backend/apprise_handler.py`):** Updated scheduled notification functions to match manual test notification format:
    - **Consistent Titles:** All notifications now use format `"[Warracker] Warranties Expiring in X Days"` instead of generic summary titles
    - **Urgency Indicators:** Added emoji prefixes based on expiration timeframe:
      - 🚨 URGENT: for warranties expiring in 1 day
      - ⚠️ IMPORTANT: for warranties expiring in ≤7 days  
      - 📅 REMINDER: for warranties expiring in >7 days
    - **Grouped by Days:** Separate notifications sent for different expiration timeframes (7, 30, 365 days) instead of combined summary
    - **Standardized Content:** Consistent bullet-point format, date formatting, and footer text across all notification types
  - **Enhanced Notification Functions:**

  - **Improved Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks around chart creation and destruction operations
  - **View Switching Stability**: Fixed chart recreation issues when switching between personal and global views
  - **Result**: Status page charts now render reliably without canvas conflicts, multiple view switches work smoothly
  - _Files: `frontend/status.js`_

- **CSS Cache Busting for Domain Consistency**
  - Added version parameters to CSS and JavaScript files across all major pages to prevent caching issues between local IP and domain access
  - **CSS Files Updated:** `style.css?v=20250529005`, `header-fix.css?v=20250529005`, `mobile-header.css?v=20250529005`, `settings-styles.css?v=20250529005`
  - **JavaScript Files Updated:** `script.js?v=20250529005`, `auth.js?v=20250529005`, `settings-new.js?v=20250529005`
  - Updated Service Worker cache name to `warracker-cache-v2` and included all versioned files to force cache refresh
  - Fixed styling inconsistencies where admin global warranty view and other features appeared differently between local IP and domain access
  - Ensures all users get consistent styling and functionality across all pages including index, settings, and status pages
  - _Files: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/settings-new.html`, `frontend/status.html`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/sw.js`_
- **Settings Page Admin Permission Issues:** Fixed critical database connection errors and 403 permission issues preventing regular users from accessing the settings page.
  - **Backend Database Connection (`backend/app.py`):** Fixed inconsistent cursor variable usage in `delete_account()` function that was causing 500 errors when users attempted to delete their accounts (was using both `cursor` and `cur` variables inconsistently).
  - **Frontend Admin Permission Checks (`frontend/settings-new.js`):** Added comprehensive admin permission checks to prevent non-admin users from triggering 403 errors:
    - **Initial Load Protection:** Wrapped admin-only settings calls (`loadSiteSettings()`, `loadAppriseSettings()`, `loadAppriseSiteSettings()`) with user admin status checks during page initialization.
    - **Deferred Load Protection:** Added admin checks for delayed Apprise settings loading to prevent unauthorized API calls.
    - **Graceful 403 Handling:** Enhanced `loadSiteSettings()` function with proper 403 response handling that hides admin sections instead of showing error messages.
  - **Improved Error Messaging:** Fixed misleading "Account cannot be deleted in offline mode" error by removing problematic nested try-catch that was masking actual API error messages. Users now see specific backend error messages instead of generic offline warnings.
  - **Root Cause:** Settings page was unconditionally calling admin-only API endpoints for all users, causing 403 errors and confusing error messages for regular users.
  - **Result:** Regular users can now access settings page without errors, see only relevant settings sections, and get clear error messages when actual issues occur. Admin users continue to see all settings sections as expected.
  - _Files: `backend/app.py`, `frontend/settings-new.js`_

- **Settings Persistence Critical Fixes:** Resolved major settings page persistence issues where user preferences would appear to save but revert to defaults when navigating away and returning.
  - **Backend Settings UPDATE Logic (`backend/app.py`):** Fixed critical bug in `/api/auth/preferences` endpoint where Apprise notification settings weren't being properly saved to the database:
    - **Column Detection Fix:** Changed condition from `if apprise_notification_time and has_apprise_notification_time_col:` to `if apprise_notification_time is not None and has_apprise_notification_time_col:` to handle empty string values properly
    - **Complete Field Mapping:** Added missing Apprise fields (`notification_channel`, `apprise_notification_time`, `apprise_notification_frequency`, `apprise_timezone`) to SELECT query return fields
    - **Preference Response Mapping:** Enhanced preference mapping to include all Apprise settings in API responses
  - **Frontend Race Condition Fixes (`frontend/settings-new.js`):** Eliminated multiple simultaneous API calls that were causing preference loading conflicts:
    - **Duplicate Request Prevention:** Fixed `loadPreferences()` being called 4 times simultaneously, causing race conditions
    - **API Priority Logic:** Ensured API data takes precedence over localStorage when both exist
    - **UI Synchronization:** Added proper dark mode toggle sync between API and UI state
    - **Authentication Token Standardization:** Unified token usage pattern across all preference save functions
  - **Root Cause:** Backend was silently failing to save Apprise settings due to strict conditional logic, while frontend race conditions were creating inconsistent data states
  - **Result:** Settings now persist correctly across page navigations, with all notification preferences saving and loading reliably
  - _Files: `backend/app.py`, `frontend/settings-new.js`_

- **Notification System Comprehensive Overhaul:** Fixed critical timing and duplicate notification issues affecting both email and Apprise scheduled notifications.
  - **Timing Logic Precision (`backend/notifications.py`):** Completely rewrote notification timing calculation for accurate delivery:
    - **Precise Windows:** Changed from aggressive "send_window or next_miss_window" logic to exact "0 <= time_diff <= 2" minute windows
    - **Post-Target Delivery:** Notifications now only send AFTER target time (not before) within 2-minute window to prevent early delivery
    - **Enhanced Time Calculations:** Added comprehensive timezone handling with detailed debug logging showing exact time differences
  - **Duplicate Prevention System (`backend/notifications.py`):** Implemented robust duplicate prevention using in-memory tracking:
    - **Separate Tracking:** Independent tracking for `email_{user_id}_{date}` and `apprise_{user_id}_{date}` patterns
    - **Daily Reset Logic:** Automatic cleanup for day rollover handling across different timezones
    - **Collision Prevention:** Added 0.1s delay for manual triggers to prevent collision with scheduled jobs
  - **Column Mismatch Fixes (`backend/notifications.py`):** Fixed database errors causing notification failures:
    - **Error Handling:** Added try/catch around column unpacking at line 327 to handle schema mismatches
    - **Variable Consistency:** Fixed missing `apprise_timezone` variable in debug logging sections
    - **Graceful Degradation:** System continues operating even with partial database schema issues
  - **Enhanced Debug Output (`backend/notifications.py`):** Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting:
    - **Time Difference Display:** Shows exact calculations like "email_time=08:20(diff:-61), apprise_time=23:28(diff:-976)"
    - **Eligibility Reasons:** Clear logging explaining why users are/aren't eligible for notifications
    - **Real-time Diagnostics:** Live timing calculations visible in Docker logs for debugging
  - **Root Cause:** Overly aggressive timing windows caused duplicate emails, while backend save issues prevented Apprise settings from persisting, leading to notifications not being scheduled
  - **Result:** Both email and Apprise notifications now work reliably with precise timing, no duplicates, and proper settings persistence
  - _Files: `backend/notifications.py`, `backend/app.py`_



#### Technical Implementation for Global View Features
- **Backend (app.py):** 
  - Added new `/api/warranties/global` endpoint accessible to all authenticated users (not just admins)
  - Added `global_view_enabled` setting to site settings with default value 'true'
  - Added `global_view_admin_only` setting to site settings with default value 'false'
  - Added `/api/settings/global-view-status` endpoint for checking global view availability per user
  - Enhanced `/api/warranties/global` endpoint to check both global view settings and user admin status
  - Added new `/api/statistics/global` endpoint for global warranty statistics with user information
- **Frontend (script.js):** 
  - Renamed `initAdminViewControls()` to `initViewControls()` and removed admin-only restrictions
  - Updated `switchToGlobalView()` to check global view setting before switching
  - Added ownership and admin validation logic to conditionally render edit/delete buttons vs view-only placeholder
  - Admins see edit/delete buttons for all warranties, regular users only for their own
  - Modified API endpoint from `/api/admin/warranties` to `/api/warranties/global` for public access
  - Added real-time global view status checking and automatic fallback to personal view
- **Frontend (index.html):** Updated tooltips and labels to reflect public access
- **Frontend (style.css):** Added styling for view-only placeholder button with eye icon
- **Frontend (settings-new.html):** Added Global View Enabled and Global View Admin Only toggles in Site Settings section
- **Frontend (settings-new.js):** Added loading and saving logic for both global view settings
- **Frontend (status.html):** Added view switcher controls and owner column to warranty table for global view
- **Frontend (status.js):** Added global view functionality with API switching, table column management, and permission checking

#### Security Features
- Backend endpoint still requires authentication (all users must be logged in)
- Frontend validates warranty ownership and admin status before showing edit/delete buttons
- **Regular users** can only modify warranties they own, even in global view
- **Admin users** can modify any warranty in global view, maintaining administrative privileges
- Maintains data privacy while providing transparency

#### User Experience
- Seamless view switching between personal and global views for all users
- Clear visual indication (eye icon) when viewing others' warranties
- Consistent UI patterns with existing admin functionality
- Enhanced tooltips explaining read-only access for non-owned warranties

### Enhanced  
- **Footer Links:** Updated all "Powered by Warracker" footer links across the application to point to `https://warracker.com` instead of the GitHub repository, providing users with direct access to the official website.
  - **Files Updated:** `index.html`, `login.html`, `register.html`, `reset-password.html`, `reset-password-request.html`, `settings-new.html`, `status.html`, `auth-redirect.html`, and `about.html`
  - **Result:** Consistent branding and improved user experience with direct access to the official Warracker website.

- **PostgreSQL Security Hardening:** Removed unnecessary SUPERUSER privileges from the application database user, significantly improving security posture.
  - **Security Improvement:** Eliminated SUPERUSER grants that provided excessive and unnecessary privileges to the application database user
  - **Files Modified:** 
    - `backend/fix_permissions.sql`: Removed `ALTER ROLE %(db_user)s WITH SUPERUSER;` 
    - `backend/migrations/011_ensure_admin_permissions.sql`: Commented out SUPERUSER grant
    - `Dockerfile`: Removed retry loop attempting to grant SUPERUSER privileges via psql
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Application now operates with only the specific database privileges required for normal operation (CREATE/DROP/ALTER on tables, sequences, functions, etc.)
  - **Testing Verified:** Full application functionality confirmed to work correctly without SUPERUSER privileges, including migrations, user management, and all admin operations
  - **Security Benefit:** Significantly reduces attack surface - if the application is compromised, an attacker no longer has complete database administrative control
  - **Result:** Maintained full application functionality while eliminating unnecessary security risks

##  0.10.0.0 - 2025-06-4

### Fixed
- **View Preference Persistence Issue:** Fixed user view preferences (Grid, List, Table) not consistently persisting across logins.
  - **Backend (`backend/app.py`):** Modified `/api/auth/login` endpoint to include `is_admin` flag in the returned user object, ensuring proper view preference key prefix calculation immediately after login.
  - **Frontend (`frontend/script.js`):** 
    - Enhanced `switchView()` function with `saveToApi` parameter to control when view preferences are saved to the API, preventing unintended overwrites during initialization.
    - Modified `loadViewPreference()` to call `switchView` with `saveToApi = false` to prevent overwriting user's actual preferences with defaults.
    - Updated storage event listener for cross-tab synchronization to prevent redundant API saves when syncing view preferences between browser tabs.
  - **Root Cause:** Missing `is_admin` flag caused incorrect localStorage prefix usage and race conditions where preferences were saved with wrong prefix then not found when correct prefix was established.
  - **Result:** View preferences now properly persist across logins and synchronize between browser tabs for both admin and regular users.
- **Password Management Issues:** Fixed critical password change and reset functionality problems.
  - **Missing Password Change Endpoint (`backend/app.py`):** Implemented `/api/auth/password/change` endpoint to allow logged-in users to change their passwords through the Settings page. The endpoint validates current password, checks new password strength, and securely updates the user's password hash.
  - **Frontend Error Handling (`frontend/settings-new.js`):** Fixed misleading "Password cannot be changed in offline mode" error by removing nested try-catch block that was masking real API error messages. Now properly displays specific backend error messages.
  - **Password Reset Link Issue (`frontend/reset-password.html`):** Fixed "Invalid or Expired Link" error by removing premature token verification that was calling a non-existent `/api/auth/password/verify-token` endpoint. Token validity is now properly checked only during form submission.
  - **Root Cause:** Backend endpoint was missing entirely, frontend had incorrect error handling, and reset page was making unnecessary token verification calls.
  - **Result:** Users can now successfully change passwords while logged in and use password reset links without encountering false error messages.
- **SMTP Port 587 (STARTTLS) Functionality:** Enhanced email sending to support both port 465 (SMTPS/SSL) and port 587 (STARTTLS) configurations.
  - **Enhanced SMTP Connection Logic (`backend/app.py`):** Updated `send_password_reset_email()`, `send_expiration_notifications()`, and `send_email_change_verification_email()` functions with robust port-based SMTP logic.
    - **Port 465:** Uses `smtplib.SMTP_SSL()` for direct SSL connection
    - **Port 587:** Uses `smtplib.SMTP()` followed by `starttls()` for STARTTLS encryption  
    - **Other Ports:** Respects `SMTP_USE_TLS` environment variable for explicit STARTTLS control
  - **Environment Variable Support:** Added intelligent defaults where `SMTP_USE_TLS` defaults to true for port 587 unless explicitly set to false, ensuring proper STARTTLS behavior.
  - **Root Cause:** Previous logic used restrictive hostname-based conditions (`if smtp_host != 'localhost'`) instead of proper port-based SMTP configuration, causing STARTTLS failures with external SMTP servers on port 587.
  - **Result:** Email sending now works reliably with both common SMTP configurations, supporting major email providers like Gmail, Office 365, and other services using port 587.
- **Header Appearance Standardization (`frontend/reset-password-request.html`, `frontend/reset-password.html`):** Standardized headers to match consistent appearance across all pages.
  - **Missing CSS Includes:** Added `header-fix.css` and `fix-auth-buttons-loader.js` to ensure consistent header styling and behavior.
  - **Clickable Title:** Made "Warracker" title a clickable link to `index.html` for consistent navigation, matching other auth pages like `login.html` and `register.html`.
  - **Registration Status Script:** Added `registration-status.js` for consistent functionality across auth pages.
  - **Root Cause:** Pages were missing key CSS files and scripts that ensure header consistency, and the title was not a link unlike other pages.
  - **Result:** Headers now have identical appearance, dimensions, and responsive behavior as other application pages, providing consistent user experience.
### Enhanced  
- **Footer Links:** Updated all "Powered by Warracker" footer links across the application to point to `https://warracker.com` instead of the GitHub repository, providing users with direct access to the official website.
  - **Files Updated:** `index.html`, `login.html`, `register.html`, `reset-password.html`, `reset-password-request.html`, `settings-new.html`, `status.html`, `auth-redirect.html`, and `about.html`
  - **Result:** Consistent branding and improved user experience with direct access to the official Warracker website.

## 0.9.9.9 - 2025-06-01

### Added
- **OIDC SSO (Single Sign-On) Integration:**
  - Implemented OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication flow using Authlib, allowing users to log in via external OIDC providers (e.g., Google, Keycloak).
  - **Backend (`app.py`):**
    - OIDC client configuration (Client ID, Secret, Issuer URL, Scope, Provider Name) is dynamically loaded from the `site_settings` database table at application startup.
    - OIDC feature can be enabled/disabled globally via the `oidc_enabled` setting in the database.
    - Added OIDC-specific routes: `/api/oidc/login` (initiates login) and `/api/oidc/callback` (handles redirect from IdP).
    - User provisioning: If an OIDC user doesn't exist locally, a new user account is created. Existing OIDC users are logged in.
    - Updated Admin Settings API (`/api/admin/settings`) to manage these OIDC parameters.
    - Database migration `023_add_oidc_columns_to_users.sql` adds `oidc_sub`, `oidc_issuer` to `users` table and `login_method` to `user_sessions` table for linking local users to OIDC identities.
  - **Frontend:**
    - **Login Page (`login.html`, `auth.js`):** Added an "Login with SSO Provider" button that initiates the OIDC flow.
    - **Admin Settings Page (`settings-new.html`, `settings-new.js`):** New "OIDC SSO Configuration" section for admins to enable/disable OIDC and configure provider details.
    - **Auth Redirect Page (`auth-redirect.html`):** Handles the token received from the `/api/oidc/callback` and logs the user in.
  - **Dependencies (`requirements.txt`):** Added `Authlib` and `requests`.
  - _Files: `backend/app.py`, `backend/migrations/023_add_oidc_columns_to_users.sql`, `backend/requirements.txt`, `frontend/login.html`, `frontend/auth.js`, `frontend/settings-new.html`, `frontend/settings-new.js`, `frontend/auth-redirect.html`_
- **SSO Registration Control:** When the site's registration setting is disabled, new users cannot register via SSO. Only existing users who already have accounts can use SSO to log in. This provides administrators with granular control over user registration while maintaining SSO functionality for existing users.
  - **Backend:** Enhanced OIDC callback handler to check the `registration_enabled` site setting before creating new user accounts via SSO.
  - **Frontend:** Added appropriate error message for users when SSO registration is blocked due to disabled registrations.
  - First user registration via SSO is still allowed regardless of the setting (same as regular registration).
  - _Files: `backend/oidc_handler.py`, `frontend/auth-redirect.html`_
- **Provider-Specific SSO Button Branding:** Enhanced the SSO login button to show provider-specific branding and icons for well-known OIDC providers.
  - **Supported Providers:** Google, GitHub, Microsoft/Azure, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Apple, Discord, GitLab, Bitbucket, Keycloak, and Okta.
  - **Dynamic Button Text:** Shows "Login with Google", "Login with GitHub", etc., based on the configured `OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME`.
  - **Provider Icons:** Uses appropriate Font Awesome icons for each provider (e.g., Google logo for Google, GitHub logo for GitHub).
  - **Brand Colors:** Each provider button uses authentic brand colors with proper hover effects.
  - **Fallback Support:** Unknown providers display the generic "Login with SSO Provider" button with default styling.
  - **Environment Integration:** Works automatically with the `OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME` environment variable and database settings.
  - _Files: `frontend/login.html`, `backend/oidc_handler.py`_
- **Exact Expiration Date Input:** Enhanced warranty entry to support exact expiration dates as an alternative to duration-based input.
  - **New Warranty Input Method:** Users can now choose between "Warranty Duration" (years/months/days) and "Exact Expiration Date" options when adding or editing warranties.
  - **UI Enhancements:** Added radio button selection for warranty entry method with smooth form field transitions and validation.
  - **Backend Support:** Both `add_warranty` and `update_warranty` API endpoints now handle `exact_expiration_date` parameter alongside duration fields.
  - **Smart Duration Display:** Warranty cards automatically calculate and display duration text even when using exact expiration dates, eliminating "N/A" values.
  - **Form Validation:** Enhanced validation ensures either exact date or duration is provided for non-lifetime warranties, with appropriate error messages.
  - **Date Calculation:** Added robust date calculation helper function that properly handles different month lengths, leap years, and edge cases.
  - _Files: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/style.css`, `backend/app.py`_
- **Complete Field Updates:** All warranty fields (product info, dates, serial numbers, tags, documents) update immediately in the interface.
  - **Fallback Safety:** Maintains fallback to server reload if local update fails, ensuring data consistency.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_
- **Memory Usage Optimization:** Significantly reduced RAM consumption for better performance on resource-constrained servers.
  - **Dynamic Memory Modes:** Configurable via `WARRACKER_MEMORY_MODE` environment variable with "optimized" (default), "ultra-light", and "performance" options.
  - **Optimized Mode:** 2 gevent workers with 128MB memory limits (~60-80MB total RAM usage).
  - **Ultra-Light Mode:** 1 sync worker with 64MB memory limit (~40-50MB total RAM usage for minimal servers).
  - **Performance Mode:** 4 gevent workers with 256MB memory limits (~150-200MB total RAM usage for high-performance servers).
  - **Worker Configuration:** Added memory limits per worker, connection pooling optimization, and preload_app for memory sharing.
  - **Database Pool:** Optimized connection pool from 10 to 4 maximum connections with memory-conscious settings.
  - **Flask Configuration:** Added memory-efficient settings including disabled JSON sorting, optimized session handling, and file serving optimizations.
  - **Dependency Addition:** Added gevent for more efficient async request handling compared to sync workers.
  - **Expected Reduction:** RAM usage configurable from ~40MB (ultra-light) to ~200MB (performance) based on server specifications.
  - _Files: `backend/gunicorn_config.py`, `backend/requirements.txt`, `backend/app.py`, `backend/db_handler.py`, `docker-compose.yml`_

- **Environment Variables for OIDC (Docker):** While OIDC configuration is primarily managed via the database through the admin UI, the `docker-compose.yml` can include placeholder environment variables for initial setup or documentation:
  - `OIDC_ENABLED` (e.g., `true` or `false`)
  - `OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME` (e.g., `google`, `keycloak`)
  - `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`
  - `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`
  - `OIDC_SCOPE` (e.g., `openid email profile`)
- **`FRONTEND_URL` Environment Variable:** Emphasized the importance of correctly setting the `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable for the backend service in `docker-compose.yml` to ensure correct OIDC callback redirects.
  - _Files: `docker-compose.yml`, `Docker/docker-compose.yml`_

### Fixed
- Resolved various startup and runtime errors related to OIDC client initialization in a multi-worker (Gunicorn) environment, particularly concerning database connection pool stability and consistent loading of OIDC settings.
- Corrected OIDC metadata fetching by ensuring the proper Issuer URL is used (e.g., `https://accounts.google.com` for Google).
- Resolved `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList')` during logout on `about.html` by ensuring the `loadingContainer` element is present and accessible to `script.js`'s `showLoading()` function. Modified `showLoading()` and `hideLoading()` to dynamically find the container if not initially available.
- Fixed `SyntaxError: Identifier 'AuthManager' has already been declared` on `about.html` by removing a duplicate import of `auth.js` from the `<head>`, ensuring it is loaded only once at the end of the `<body>`.
- Standardized the user menu dropdown button ID to `userMenuBtn` across `index.html`, `status.html`, and `about.html`. Consolidated user menu JavaScript logic into `auth.js`, removing redundant code from `settings-new.js` and `fix-auth-buttons.js` to ensure consistent dropdown behavior.
  - _Files: `backend/app.py`, `frontend/about.html`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/status.html`, `frontend/auth.js`, `frontend/settings-new.js`, `frontend/fix-auth-buttons.js`_
- **SSO Warranty Display Issue:** Fixed a critical timing problem where SSO users would see a blank warranty list after login. The issue was caused by a race condition where user preferences were loaded before user authentication was fully established.
  - Enhanced `auth-redirect.html` to fetch and store user information immediately after SSO login, ensuring `user_info` is available when the main application loads.
  - Fixed preference key prefix calculation to prevent mismatched user preference keys for SSO users.
  - _Files: `frontend/auth-redirect.html`, `frontend/auth.js`, `frontend/script.js`_
- **SSO Tag Creation Issue:** Resolved an issue where SSO users could not create new tags due to authentication token handling problems.
  - Updated tag creation functions (`createTag`, `updateTag`, `deleteTag`) to use `window.auth.getToken()` instead of directly accessing localStorage.
  - Added enhanced error handling and debugging for tag creation API calls.
  - Ensured consistent token management across all tag-related operations.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_
- **Database Tag Constraint Issue:** Fixed database constraint violation that prevented users from creating tags with names that already existed for other users.
  - Created migration `024_fix_tags_constraint.sql` to update the database schema.
  - Dropped the old `tags_name_key` unique constraint that only considered tag names.
  - Added new `tags_name_user_id_key` constraint allowing the same tag name for different users.
  - Added proper user_id foreign key constraint and performance index.
  - _Files: `backend/migrations/024_fix_tags_constraint.sql`_
- **About Page User Menu Issue:** Fixed user menu dropdown not functioning on the about page for SSO users.
  - Resolved script loading order conflicts that prevented user menu event listeners from being attached.
  - Moved inline authentication check from head to body to prevent timing conflicts with `auth.js`.
  - Added backup user menu handler specifically for the about page with enhanced debugging.
  - Fixed JavaScript error caused by `getEventListeners` function not being available in all browsers.
  - _Files: `frontend/about.html`, `frontend/auth.js`_
- **About Page Logout Issue:** Resolved logout functionality errors on the about page.
  - Added safe loading spinner functions specifically for the about page to prevent `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList')` error.
  - Implemented backup logout handler with multiple fallback levels for reliability.
  - Ensured logout works even when main auth system encounters errors.
  - _Files: `frontend/about.html`, `frontend/script.js`_
- **Immediate Warranty Updates:** Optimized warranty editing for instant UI updates without server reloads.
  - **Performance Improvement:** Warranty changes now appear immediately in the UI instead of waiting for server data reload.
  - **Local Data Sync:** Edit modal updates local warranty data instantly upon successful save, eliminating loading delays.
  - **Robust Date Handling:** Enhanced date arithmetic for duration-based warranties with proper month/year overflow handling.
  - **Complete Field Updates:** All warranty fields (product info, dates, serial numbers, tags, documents) update immediately in the interface.
  - **Fallback Safety:** Maintains fallback to server reload if local update fails, ensuring data consistency.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_
- **Warranty Entry Method Persistence:** Fixed warranty entry method selection not being remembered correctly in edit modal.
  - **Issue:** When editing warranties that were created using "Exact Expiration Date" method, the edit modal would incorrectly switch to "Warranty Duration" method.
  - **Root Cause:** Display logic was overwriting original duration values (0,0,0 for exact date method), making method detection impossible.
  - **Solution:** Added `original_input_method` tracking to preserve the user's original warranty entry method choice.
  - **Data Separation:** Implemented separate `display_duration_*` fields for warranty card display while preserving original duration values for method detection.
  - **Enhanced Detection:** Edit modal now directly checks `original_input_method` field instead of guessing from duration data.
  - **Result:** Users can now edit warranties and the modal correctly remembers whether they originally used "Warranty Duration" or "Exact Expiration Date" method.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_
- **Notes Modal and Edit Modal Integration:** Fixed issues with notes editing workflow and seamless transition to warranty editing.
  - **Notes Editing for Exact Date Warranties:** Resolved issue where warranties created with exact expiration dates couldn't have their notes edited via the notes-link modal due to invalid duration validation.
  - **Stale Notes in Edit Modal:** Fixed problem where editing a warranty immediately after saving notes via the notes modal would show old note content instead of the newly saved content.
  - **Notes Modal UI Issues:** Fixed "Edit Notes" button showing outdated note content when clicked after saving new notes in the same modal session.
  - **Enhanced Notes Modal:** Added "Edit Warranty" button directly in the notes modal footer for seamless transition to full warranty editing without modal layering conflicts.
  - **Immediate Data Sync:** Enhanced notes saving to immediately update the global warranties array, ensuring edit modal always shows current data.
  - **Modal State Management:** Improved modal closing behavior when opening edit modal from notes modal to prevent UI conflicts.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`_
- **Status Page Edit Modal Consistency:** Fixed inconsistency between edit warranty modals on index.html and status.html pages.
  - **Missing Warranty Entry Method Selection:** Added the "Warranty Entry Method" radio button selection to the status.html edit modal, allowing users to choose between "Warranty Duration" and "Exact Expiration Date" methods.
  - **Missing Exact Expiration Field:** Added the hidden "Exact Expiration Date" input field that appears when the exact date method is selected.
  - **Feature Parity:** The edit warranty modal on status.html now has identical functionality to the one on index.html, ensuring consistent user experience across both pages.
  - **Complete Modal Structure:** All tabs (Product, Warranty, Documents, Tags), form fields, and functionality now match exactly between both pages.
  - _Files: `frontend/status.html`_

### Dependencies
- **Updated Python Dependencies:** Resolved `pkg_resources` deprecation warning by updating backend dependencies to modern versions.
  - **Gunicorn:** Updated from `20.1.0` to `23.0.0` - eliminates `pkg_resources` deprecation warning by using `importlib.metadata` instead.
  - **Flask:** Updated from `2.0.1` to `3.0.3` - includes security patches and improved compatibility.
  - **Werkzeug:** Updated from `2.0.1` to `3.0.3` - maintains compatibility with Flask 3.x.
  - **Other Dependencies:** Updated `flask-cors`, `Flask-Login`, `PyJWT`, `email-validator`, `python-dateutil`, `Authlib`, `requests`, and `gevent` to latest stable versions.
  - **Setuptools Protection:** Added `setuptools<81` pin to prevent future compatibility issues.
  - _Files: `backend/requirements.txt`_

### Frontend
- **Chart.js Compatibility Fix:** Resolved "Chart is not defined" error on status page by replacing ES module version with UMD version.
  - **Issue:** Status page charts failed to load with `ReferenceError: Chart is not defined` because the local `chart.js` file was in ES module format.
  - **Root Cause:** ES modules require `<script type="module">` tags but the HTML was using regular `<script>` tags.
  - **Solution:** Replaced ES module version with locally downloaded UMD (Universal Module Definition) version from Chart.js v4.4.9, eliminating CDN dependency.
  - **Result:** Chart.js now loads properly with regular script tags and status page charts display correctly using the local file.
  - _Files: `frontend/chart.js`_
- **Product Name Hover Tooltips:** Added hover tooltips to display full product names when they are truncated with ellipsis.
  - **Enhancement:** Long product names that get cut off with "..." now show the complete product name in a tooltip when hovered over.
  - **Coverage:** Works across all warranty display modes (grid view, list view, table view) on the main warranties page and the status page table.
  - **Implementation:** Added `title` attributes to warranty titles and product name cells using escaped HTML for security.
  - **Result:** Users can now see full product names without having to edit or expand warranty details.
  - _Files: `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/status.js`_
- **Powered by Warracker Footer:** Added branded footer to all pages with dynamic theme support and GitHub repository link.
  - **Feature:** Added "Powered by Warracker" footer to all application pages linking to the GitHub repository.
  - **Theme Support:** Implemented JavaScript-based dynamic styling that automatically adapts to light/dark mode changes.
  - **Light Mode:** Light gray background (`#f5f5f5`), dark text (`#333333`), blue links (`#3498db`) matching the logo.
  - **Dark Mode:** Dark background (`#1a1a1a`), light text (`#e0e0e0`), light blue links (`#4dabf7`).
  - **Real-time Updates:** Uses MutationObserver to detect theme changes and update footer styling automatically.
  - **Cross-domain Compatibility:** Includes fallback inline styles and direct color values to ensure consistent display across different hosting environments.
  - _Files: All frontend HTML pages, `frontend/style.css`_

## [0.9.9.8] - 2025-05-24

### Added
- **Account Email Change:** Users can now change the email address associated with their account from the Settings page.
  - The email field in Account Settings is now editable.
  - Client-side and backend validation ensure the new email is valid and not already in use by another account.
  - The backend prevents duplicate emails and returns clear error messages for conflicts or invalid formats.
  - On successful change, the new email is reflected in the UI and localStorage, and users must use the new email to log in.
  - _Files: `frontend/settings-new.html`, `frontend/settings-new.js`, `backend/app.py`_
- **Progressive Web App (PWA) Support:** Enabled the application to be installed on Android devices.

## [0.9.9.7] - 2025-05-16

### Added
- **Status Page - Collapsible Warranty Details**: Users can now click on a warranty row in the "Recently Expired or Expiring Soon" table on the Status page to expand a details section inline. This section displays more comprehensive information about the warranty, including Product URL, Purchase Price, Vendor, links to documents (Invoice, Manual, Other Files), Serial Numbers, and Notes.
  - Clicking the same row again collapses the details view.
  - Only one warranty's details can be expanded at a time.
  _Files: `frontend/status.js`, `frontend/style.css`_
- **Edit Warranty from Status Page**: You can now edit warranty details directly from the status page by clicking the "Edit Warranty" button in the expanded details section. This opens the edit modal with all warranty information pre-filled for editing.

- Added vendor column to sort options on the main warranty list.
  _Files: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/script.js`_
- Added vendor filter dropdown to the main warranty list.
  _Files: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/script.js`_

### Changed
- **Status Page Table**: Modified the Status page table to no longer link product names directly to a separate details page (related to the collapsible details feature).
  _Files: `frontend/status.js`_
- Updated CSV export functionality to format dates as YYYY-MM-DD.
  _Files: `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/status.js`_

### Fixed
- Fixed a console error "An invalid form control with name='product_url' is not focusable" that occurred when entering a product URL without a scheme (e.g., "example.com") in a hidden tab.
  - Changed `productUrl` and `editProductUrl` input types from `url` to `text` in `frontend/index.html` to prevent premature browser validation conflicts with the tabbed interface.
  - Enhanced `validateTab`, `showValidationErrors`, and `validateEditTab` in `frontend/script.js` to more reliably use HTML5 `control.validity.valid` and `control.validationMessage`, ensuring that if a field is invalid, its tab is shown and JavaScript-driven error messages are displayed.
  _Files: `frontend/script.js`_
- Resolved issue where the edit modal would close on backdrop click; it now only closes via the 'X' or 'Cancel' buttons.
  _Files: `frontend/script.js`_
- Resolved an issue where database migrations could fail if a custom `DB_NAME` was used. The hardcoded database name has been removed from migration files to support custom database names. (Thanks to @humrochagf for the contribution!)
  _Files: `backend/migrations/010_configure_admin_roles.sql`, `backend/migrations/011_ensure_admin_permissions.sql`_

## [0.9.9.6] - 2025-05-11

### Added
- **Warranty Duration Input:** Replaced the single "Warranty Period (Years)" input field with separate fields for Years, Months, and Days when adding or editing warranties.
  - Allows for more precise warranty duration entry (e.g., 2 years, 6 months, 15 days).
  - Updated Add/Edit forms (`frontend/index.html`), JavaScript logic (`frontend/script.js`), CSS styling (`frontend/style.css`), backend API (`backend/app.py`), and database schema (`backend/migrations/021_change_warranty_duration_to_components.sql`).
  - Warranty display on cards and summaries now shows the formatted duration (e.g., "2 years, 6 months").
  - CSV import/export updated to use `WarrantyDurationYears`, `WarrantyDurationMonths`, `WarrantyDurationDays` columns.
  - Backend validation ensures at least one duration component is provided for non-lifetime warranties.
  - Fixed backend logic to correctly handle empty duration inputs, treating them as 0.
  _Files: `backend/app.py`, `backend/migrations/021_change_warranty_duration_to_components.sql`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/style.css`_
- **Files Upload:** Users can now upload an additional ZIP/RAR file (e.g., for extended warranty documents, photos, or other related files) when adding or editing a warranty.
  - This document is stored securely and can be accessed from the warranty card.
  - _Files: `backend/app.py`, `backend/migrations/022_add_other_document_path.sql`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/script.js`_
- **Configurable JWT Secret Key:**
  - The application's JWT and session secret key can now be configured via the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
  - It is strongly recommended to set a unique, strong secret key in production environments. Defaults to a development key if not set.
  - _Relevant File: `backend/app.py` (for usage), `docker-compose.yml` (for setting)_
- **Configurable File Upload Limits:**
  - Maximum file upload sizes for both the backend application and the Nginx reverse proxy are now configurable via environment variables.
  - **Application (Flask):** Set `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` (e.g., `MAX_UPLOAD_MB=64`) to define the limit in megabytes. Defaults to 32MB.
  - **Nginx:** Set `NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE_VALUE` (e.g., `NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE_VALUE=64M`) to define the limit for Nginx (value must include unit like M or G). Defaults to "32M".
  - The `Dockerfile` and `nginx.conf` have been updated to support this.
  - _Files: `backend/app.py`, `nginx.conf`, `Dockerfile`_
- **Security key can be used in environment:**
   - **SECRET_KEY=**  is now usuable in docker-compose for jwt secret.
   - _Files: `Docker/docker-compose.yml`_

### Fixed
- **Backend Indentation Error:** Corrected an `IndentationError` in `backend/app.py` within the CSV import logic that prevented the backend from starting correctly.
  _Files: `backend/app.py`_
- **Migration Script Error:** Fixed an error in migration `021_change_warranty_duration_to_components.sql` where it incorrectly referenced `lifetime_warranty` instead of the correct `is_lifetime` column.
  _Files: `backend/migrations/021_change_warranty_duration_to_components.sql`_
- **smtplib import duplicate:** Removed line from app.py that re-imported smtplib with a pull request.
- _Files: `backend/app.py`_

### House Cleaning
- **Old Settings files:** Removed all older settings pages , and related files.
- _Files: `frontend/settings.html`,`frontend/settings.script.js`,`frontend/settings_redirect.html`_

## [0.9.9.5] - 2025-05-07

### Changed
- **Header Branding Improvement:**
  - Made the "Warracker" text in the header of the Status, Settings, and About pages a clickable link to the home page (`index.html`) for improved navigation and consistency.
  _Files: `frontend/status.html`, `frontend/settings-new.html`, `frontend/about.html`_

- **Tag Dropdown Color Removal:**
  - Removed all background and text colours from the tags dropdown in both dark mode and light mode for a cleaner, more consistent appearance.

  - Updated the `Dockerfile` to use Python 3.12 and Debian 12 (bookworm) as the base image for the container, ensuring improved compatibility and security.
  _File: `Dockerfile`_


## [0.9.9.4] - 2025-05-04

### Fixed
- **Theme Persistence & Consistency:**
  - Refactored dark mode logic to use only a single `localStorage` key (`darkMode`) as the source of truth for theme preference across all pages.
  - Removed all legacy and user-prefixed theme keys (e.g., `user_darkMode`, `admin_darkMode`, `${prefix}darkMode`).
  - Ensured all theme toggles and settings update only the `darkMode` key, and all pages read only this key for theme initialization.
  - Verified that `theme-loader.js` is included early in every HTML file to prevent flashes of incorrect theme.
  - Cleaned up redundant or conflicting theme logic in all frontend scripts and HTML files.
  - Theme preference now persists reliably across logins, logouts, and browser sessions (except in incognito/private mode, where localStorage is temporary by design).
  _Files: `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/settings-new.js`, `frontend/status.js`, `frontend/register.html`, `frontend/reset-password.html`, `frontend/reset-password-request.html`, `frontend/theme-loader.js`, all main HTML files._

### Added
- **Admin/User Tag Separation:**
  - Implemented distinct tags for Admins and regular Users.
  - Tags created by an Admin are only visible to other Admins.
  - Tags created by a User are only visible to other Users.
  - Added `is_admin_tag` boolean column to the `tags` table via migration (`backend/migrations/009_add_admin_flag_to_tags.sql`).
  - Backend API endpoints (`/api/tags`, `/api/warranties`, `/api/warranties/<id>/tags`) updated to filter tags based on the logged-in user's role (`is_admin`).
  - Tag creation (`POST /api/tags`) now automatically sets the `is_admin_tag` flag based on the creator's role.
  - Tag update (`PUT /api/tags/<id>`) and deletion (`DELETE /api/tags/<id>`) endpoints now prevent users/admins from modifying tags belonging to the other role.
  _Files: `backend/app.py`, `backend/migrations/009_add_admin_flag_to_tags.sql`_

  - **Version Check:**

  - Added a version checker to the About page (`frontend/about.html`) that compares the current version with the latest GitHub release and displays the update status.

  - The field is available when adding a new warranty and when editing an existing warranty.
  - The vendor is displayed on warranty cards and in the summary tab of the add warranty wizard.
  - The vendor field is now searchable alongside product name, notes, and tags.
  - Backend API and database updated to support this field, including a migration to add the column to the warranties table.
  - Editing a warranty now correctly updates the vendor field.
  _Files: `backend/app.py`, `backend/migrations/017_add_vendor_to_warranties.sql`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/script.js`_

- **Serial Number Search:**
  - Enhanced search functionality to include serial numbers.
  - Updated search input placeholder text to reflect serial number search capability.
  _Files: `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/index.html`_

- **CSV Import Vendor Field:**
  - Added support for importing the `Vendor` field via CSV file upload.
  - The CSV header should be `Vendor`.
  _Files: `backend/app.py`, `frontend/script.js`_

  - Users can now choose their preferred date display format in Settings > Preferences.
  - Available formats include:
    - Month/Day/Year (e.g., 12/31/2024)
    - Day/Month/Year (e.g., 31/12/2024)
    - Year-Month-Day (e.g., 2024-12-31)
    - Mon Day, Year (e.g., Dec 31, 2024)
    - Day Mon Year (e.g., 31 Dec 2024)
    - Year Mon Day (e.g., 2024 Dec 31)
  - The selected format is applied to purchase and expiration dates on warranty cards.
  - The setting persists across sessions and is synchronized between open tabs.
  _Files: `frontend/settings-new.html`, `frontend/settings-new.js`, `frontend/script.js`_

- **IPv6 Support:** Added `listen [::]:80;` directive to the Nginx configuration (`nginx.conf`) to enable listening on IPv6 interfaces alongside IPv4.
  _Files: `nginx.conf`_

- **Cloudflare Compatibility:** Added `<script data-cfasync="false" src="/javascript.js">` to the `<head>` of the status page (`frontend/status.html`) to ensure proper loading when behind Cloudflare.
  _Files: `frontend/status.html`_

  ### Changed
  - **Migration System Overhaul:** Refactored the database migration system for improved reliability and consistency.
  - **House cleaning**: Removed redundant files such as migrations, .env, and uploads folder. 
  - **Warranty Listing:** Admins now only see their own warranties on the main warranty list (`/api/warranties`).
  - **Warranty Visibility:** Fixed issue where admins could see all users' warranties. Now both admins and regular users only see their own warranties on all pages.
  _Files: `backend/app.py`_

**Bug Fixes:**

*   **Date Handling:** Fixed issues causing warranty purchase and expiration dates to display incorrectly (off by one day) due to timezone differences:
    *   **Backend:** Corrected expiration date calculation in `backend/app.py` by removing the inaccurate `timedelta` fallback logic and ensuring the `python-dateutil` library (using `relativedelta`) is consistently used for accurate year addition.
    *   **Backend:** Added `python-dateutil` to `backend/requirements.txt` dependencies.
    *   **Frontend:** Updated date parsing in `frontend/script.js` (`processWarrantyData`) to use `Date.UTC()` when creating `Date` objects from `YYYY-MM-DD` strings, preventing local timezone interpretation.
    *   **Frontend:** Simplified and corrected date formatting in `frontend/script.js` (`formatDate`) to always use UTC date components (`getUTCFullYear`, etc.) for display, bypassing potential `toLocaleDateString` timezone issues.
    *   **Frontend:** Fixed purchase date display in the "Add Warranty" summary tab (`updateSummary` in `frontend/script.js`) by applying the same UTC-based parsing and formatting used elsewhere, resolving the off-by-one-day error during summary view.
*   **Fractional Warranty Years & Date Accuracy:** Corrected the backend expiration date calculation (`backend/app.py`) to accurately handle fractional warranty years (e.g., 1.5 years) and prevent off-by-one-day errors. 
    *   The initial fix for fractional years used an approximation (`timedelta`) which sometimes resulted in dates being a day early.
    *   The calculation now uses `dateutil.relativedelta` after decomposing the fractional years into integer years, months, and days, ensuring correct handling of leap years and month lengths.
*   **UI:** Fixed toasts overlapping header menu due to z-index conflict (`style.css`).
*   **API:** Fixed bug preventing updates to user preferences if only the timezone was changed (`app.py`).
*   **Settings:** Resolved issue where opening the settings page in multiple tabs could cause both tabs to refresh continuously and potentially log the user out. This involved:
    *   Preventing `settings-new.js` from unnecessarily updating `user_info` in `localStorage` on load.
    *   Changing the `storage` event listener in `include-auth-new.js` to update the UI directly instead of reloading the page when auth data changes.
    *   Removing redundant checks (`setInterval`) and `storage` listener from `fix-auth-buttons.js` to prevent conflicts.

**New Features & Enhancements:**

*   **API:** Added `/api/timezones` endpoint to provide a structured list of timezones grouped by region (`app.py`).

### Fixed
- **Tag Visibility:** Fixed an issue where tag visibility was incorrectly reversed between Admins and Users (Users saw Admin tags and vice-versa). Adjusted backend logic to correctly display tags based on role.
  _Files: `backend/app.py`_
- Fixed currency symbol not persisting after browser restart/re-login:
    - Prevented main warranty list from rendering before user authentication and preferences are fully loaded.
    - Ensured preferences (currency, date format, etc.) are fetched from API and saved to localStorage immediately after login.
    - Corrected inconsistent user type prefix (`user_` vs `admin_`) determination during initial page load.

## [0.9.9.3] - 2025-04-27

### Added

 - **Document Deletion in Edit Warranty:**
    - Users can now delete uploaded documents (Invoice/Receipt and Product Manual) when editing an existing warranty.

    - Backend and database are updated to remove the file from storage and clear the reference in the database.
  _Files: `backend/app.py`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/script.js`_

### Changed
- **Status Page Table:** Removed the "Actions" column (and its buttons) from the "Recently Expired or Expiring Soon" table on `status.html` for a cleaner look.
- **Table Layout:** Updated the table and CSS to use dynamic column widths, eliminating empty space after the Status column and ensuring the table fills the available space naturally.
- **UI Polish:** Fixed awkward right-side spacing in the table and removed all flex styling and fixed-width rules for the last column, so the table now adapts responsively to its content.
- **CSS Cleanup:** Cleaned up and removed obsolete or conflicting CSS rules for the recent expirations table, resolving layout and syntax errors.
- **Status Page Table Sorting:**
    - Fixed date comparison logic in the sort function to correctly handle `Date` objects.
    - Refactored event listener attachment for sortable table headers to prevent duplicate listeners being added, resolving issues where sorting only worked once or behaved erratically.
    - Ensured all event listeners (sort, filter, search, export, refresh) are attached reliably after initial data load and rendering.
  _Files: `frontend/status.html`, `frontend/status.js`, `frontend/style.css`_

- **Mobile Export Button:** On mobile devices, the export button at the bottom of the status page now only displays the icon (no text), for a cleaner and more compact UI. The text remains visible on desktop.
- **Mobile Search Functionality:** The search box for recent expirations at the bottom of the status page now works correctly on mobile, with event listeners properly initialized to ensure filtering works as expected on all devices.
  _Files: `frontend/status.html`, `frontend/status.js`, `frontend/style.css`_

### Fixed
- **Settings Toggle Size:** Fixed inconsistent toggle switch sizing on mobile views, ensuring all toggles render at the correct dimensions (`47x24px`).
  _File: `frontend/settings-styles.css`_
- **Username Display:** Resolved an issue where user interface elements sometimes incorrectly displayed the username instead of the first name (or vice versa).
  _Files: `frontend/settings-new.js`, `frontend/auth.js` 
- **List/Table View:** Implemented updates and fixes for the warranty list and table views, improving layout and data presentation.
  _Files: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/style.css`_

  - The backend, frontend UI, and CSV import/export all support decimal warranty years.
  - Validation and expiration date calculations have been updated to handle decimal years correctly.
  - The UI now allows decimal input for warranty years and displays fractional years in summaries and warranty lists.

### Changed
- **Theme:** Unified theme persistence using a single `localStorage` key (`darkMode`) and centralized the loading logic in `theme-loader.js` to enhance consistency and eliminate theme-flashing on load.  
  _Files: `frontend/theme-loader.js`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/status.js`, `frontend/settings-new.js`, `frontend/settings-new.html`_

- **UI/UX:** Updated the "Add Warranty" modal behavior to only close when the internal 'X' button is clicked. Clicking the backdrop no longer closes the modal. This change is specific to this modal—others retain default backdrop behavior.  
  _File: `frontend/script.js`_

### Fixed
- **Wizard Navigation:** 
  - Ensured the summary tab in the "Add Warranty" wizard displays and updates correctly.  
  - Resolved JS errors (`TypeError: Assignment to constant variable`, `ReferenceError: tabs is not defined`) that affected tab functionality.  
  - Fixed scope issues with backdrop click handlers impacting modal behavior.  
  _File: `frontend/script.js`_

- **Header Layout (Desktop):** Standardized header layout across pages by wrapping elements in a `.header-right-group` container and applying consistent styles.  
  _Files: `index.html`, `status.html`, `about.html`, `settings-new.html`, `frontend/header-fix.css`_

- **Header Layout (Mobile):** Corrected alignment of header elements—title is now left-aligned, user/settings icons right-aligned, and navigation links centered below. Used `!important` to resolve conflicts with desktop styles.  
  _File: `frontend/mobile-header.css`_

- **Theme:** Fixed site-wide dark/light mode persistence. Changes made on one page now reflect consistently across all pages. Standardized use of `darkMode` and `${prefix}darkMode` keys in relevant scripts.  
  _Files: `frontend/status.js`, others using `setTheme` / `initializeTheme`_

- **User Menu:** Fixed dropdown not opening due to a variable typo. Centralized gear menu toggle logic into `auth.js` for consistent behavior, removing redundant initializations.  
  _Files: `frontend/auth.js`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/settings-new.js`_

- **JavaScript Errors:** Addressed multiple errors (`ReferenceError`, `TypeError`) related to function order, missing element checks, and incorrect variable usage—primarily impacting `status.html` and pages using `script.js`.  
  _Files: `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/status.js`_

- **API Integration:** Fixed parsing logic for `/api/statistics` response to correctly interpret the API structure.  
  _File: `frontend/status.js`_

### Removed
- **Settings Gear Icon:** The settings gear icon button and its menu have been removed from the header in all main pages for a cleaner and less redundant UI. 
  _Files: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/status.html`, `frontend/about.html`_


## [0.9.9.1] - 2025-04-13

### Added
- **About Page:** Added a new "About" page accessible via `/about.html` (`frontend/about.html`).
  - Displays application version, links to GitHub repository, releases, author profile, license (AGPL-3.0), and issue tracker.
- **UI:** Added an "About" link to the user menu dropdown in the header, appearing after "Settings" (`frontend/index.html`, `frontend/status.html`, `frontend/settings-new.html`).
- **UI/UX:** Refactored the "Add New Warranty" form into a modal dialog (`#addWarrantyModal`) triggered by a button click, instead of being always visible on the main page (`frontend/index.html`, `frontend/script.js`, `frontend/style.css`).
  - The modal is initially hidden and displayed using JavaScript.
  - Added event listeners to show/hide the modal on button click, close button click, and backdrop click.
  - Implemented `resetAddWarrantyWizard` function to clear the form, reset tabs, tags, and file inputs when the modal is closed or submitted successfully.
  - Modified form submission (`submitForm`) to close and reset the modal upon success.
- **UI:** Moved the "Add New Warranty" button (`#showAddWarrantyBtn`) from the top of the main content area into the header of the "Your Warranties" panel (`.panel-header`) for better context (`frontend/index.html`).
- **Layout:** Adjusted the `.warranties-panel` CSS to span the full width (`grid-column: 1 / -1;`) after the form was moved out of the main grid flow (`frontend/style.css`).
- **Layout:** Updated `.panel-header` CSS to use Flexbox for aligning the title (`h2`) to the left and action buttons (`.panel-header-actions` containing Add Warranty and Refresh buttons) to the right (`frontend/style.css`).
- **Layout:** Removed the `border-bottom` style from the `.panel-header` / `.warranties-panel h2` for a cleaner look (`frontend/style.css`).
- **Branding:** Updated the website `<title>` to include "Warracker" (`frontend/index.html`).
- **UI:** Added an "Add New Warranty" button (`#showAddWarrantyBtn`) to trigger the new modal (`frontend/index.html`
