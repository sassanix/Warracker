## Why I Built This

Warracker was born from personal frustration with warranty confusion. When my father’s dishwasher broke, we had the invoice and assumed it was under warranty, only to find out we were referencing the wrong one, and the warranty had ended by a couple of months.

That experience, along with others like it, made me realize how common and avoidable these issues are. So I built **Warracker**, a simple, organized way to track purchases, receipts, and warranties. It has already saved me money by reminding me to get car repairs done before my warranty expired.

Inspired by [**Wallos**](https://github.com/ellite/Wallos), I wanted to bring the same clarity to warranties that it brought to subscriptions and share it with anyone who's ever been burned by missed coverage.
